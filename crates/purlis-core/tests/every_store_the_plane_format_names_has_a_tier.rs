//! **Every store `docs/plane-format.md` names has a storage tier** (ADR 0069).
//!
//! There are four tiers: **Plane** (committed), **Clone state** (`.charter/` and the other
//! per-clone files git does not carry), **Machine** (outside every plane, each store either
//! `syncable` or `device-bound`) and **Keyring**. A store's tier decides whether FR-10's backup
//! carries it, whether a second machine may receive it, and whether deleting it costs anything
//! but a rebuild. A store that lands without one has had none of those questions asked, so this
//! test fails until it has.
//!
//! What it reads, between the heading "Finding the plane" and the appendix:
//!
//! - **Every `###` and `####` heading** carries a `**Tier:**` line in its section, unless it is
//!   listed in [`NOT_STORES`] with the reason it is not a store (a key, a group whose entries
//!   carry their own tiers, a rule, a list of conventions). So a new heading, with or without a
//!   path in backticks, fails until somebody gives it a tier or argues in a diff that it is not
//!   a store.
//! - **Every table whose first column is `Path`** has a `Tier` column, because a table of paths
//!   is a list of stores (`workspace-rename.json` is recorded only in one).
//! - **Every tier said anywhere in that range is one the ADR defines**, spelled as [`check`]
//!   reads it.
//!
//! What it does not read: a store named only inside a paragraph or a bullet, under a heading
//! that is about something else. The document's convention is that every store has its own
//! heading or table row, and review holds that convention; this test holds the tiers.
//!
//! **Why a line walker and not a Markdown parser.** The document's structure is line-shaped:
//! ATX headings at the start of a line, `|` tables, ``` fences. A parser such as
//! `pulldown-cmark` would be a new dependency for one doc test, and it would not make the
//! checks more exact, because a tier is a convention inside a list item's text either way. The
//! walker skips fenced blocks, and the tests at the bottom pin what it reads.
