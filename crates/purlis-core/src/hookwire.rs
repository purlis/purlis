//! its chat's spool beside the socket, when the app does not take its line ([`spool`], FD-30).

/// forgets it the moment it is spent or the deadline passes, one `charter handoff`
/// opens at most one chat.
///
/// **What it does not buy, plainly.** It does not say which process in the chat asked. A
/// process already inside the chat's own process tree has the socket path and the chat number
/// in its environment, so it can run this same two-line exchange — or simply exec
/// `charter handoff` itself. charter cannot tell that process from the chat's own turn: a helper
/// sub-agent is refused by the tool hook where the hook can tell one made the call, and that is
/// advice it meets, not a boundary. So **what consents to a handoff is never the request**: it
/// is the app's own decision, from its own record of the asking chat and the dispatch grants
/// the person made (`dispatchdecision`), and a grant for a pair covers whatever in that chat's
/// tree asks in its name. ADR 0024 concedes exactly this for *moving* a chat, and this is the

/// window the operator is looking at, whose first message is stamped with the chat it came from
/// (`⟨handoff from chat N · …⟩`). That is strictly more visible than what the tree could
/// already do. **Visibility is the control here, not the ticket**, which is why the app never
/// opens a handed-off chat anywhere but on a strip, and why the stamp is not optional.
