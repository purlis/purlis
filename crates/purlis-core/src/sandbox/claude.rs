//! The policy compiled for Claude Code: a `sandbox` object and `permissions.deny` rules, in
//! the `--settings` charter already hands each chat ([`crate::harness`]).
//!
//! Read out of Claude Code 2.1.285's settings schema, and measured live against it on macOS:
//!
//! - `sandbox` confines the commands its Bash tool runs. Its Read and Edit tools run in its
//!   own process, and a `permissions.deny` rule is what holds them, so every denied path is
//!   written twice: once for the sandbox and once for the tools.
//! - Its web tools run in its own process too, and are not held to the sandbox's allowed hosts
//!   (measured: a fetch of an unlisted host succeeded under `strictAllowlist`). No setting
//!   limits them to a list of hosts, and an allow cannot outrank a deny, so both are denied.
//! - `--settings` sits above project settings, and a project file is not honoured on the keys
//!   that loosen a sandbox.
//! - Where a class is held by a service no key in its settings can deny, and the service does not
//!   hold it either, the chat is refused ([`super::NotStarted::Uncompilable`]) rather than
//!   started without it. Its sandbox lets a command ask the keychain's service (its profile
//!   allows the lookup), so on macOS the vaults class rests on the keyring items' own access
//!   rule (ruling V90a): a command that reads one is refused or the person is asked.
//!
//! Measured live on 2.1.285 on macOS, a headless chat started with what [`settings`] writes: a
//! command could neither read nor write a denied directory, could write its own directory,
//! reached a listed host, and was refused an unlisted one; and with the web tools denied they
//! were not offered to the model at all, even when named in `--allowedTools`.
//!
//! **The later-code class** (ruling V73b). Measured on 2.1.288 on macOS, a headless turn against
//! a stand-in model server: Claude Code's own sandbox already kept a command from writing git's
//! config and hooks (in a nested clone too), `.mcp.json`, `.vscode`, `.idea`, `.claude`'s
//! settings, commands and agents, and shell startup files, and let it write `opencode.json`,
//! `.opencode`, `.codex`, `.envrc` and `charter.toml`. With each name added to `denyWrite` as
//! `**/<name>`, every one was refused at any depth, and an ordinary file was still written.
//! `.claude/skills`, `tui.json`, `tui.jsonc` and `.agents`, added later (#1057), are held by
//! the same `**/<name>` rule. The project's manifests are not (#1336): they are denied by path,
//! at the project root and in each folder from the chat's up to it ([`Settings::denying`]).
//! What it does not hold: a command moved a directory holding a `config` into a nested
//! clone's `.git` (measured), and no glob can deny the `.git` itself without denying what git
//! writes below it (#1065).
//!
//! **The hook socket** (ADR 0067 §2, #1328). A `purlis` command a chat runs is part of the chat
//! and asks the app over the socket in `$PURLIS_HOOK_SOCKET`; Claude Code's sandbox refuses
//! every unix socket it is not told to allow. The socket is known only where the chat opens, so
//! [`Settings::reporting_on`] adds it then, as the one path in `network.allowUnixSockets`.
//! Read out of Claude Code 2.1.291's own settings schema: `allowUnixSockets` is a list of
//! paths, *"macOS only … Ignored on Linux (seccomp cannot filter by path)"*, merged across
//! settings sources, and its macOS profile allows each as a `subpath` for connect **and bind**.
//! The bind is harmless only while the chat cannot replace the socket, so the socket's folder is
//! denied to writes beside it: under the project's state folder that is denied already, and the
//! fallback folder in the temp directory is not. `allowAllUnixSockets` is set `false`, never
//! left out, so a user's `true` cannot merge in. On Linux a sandboxed chat reaches no socket.
//!
//! **Through purlis's proxy** (#1665). Read out of Claude Code 2.1.296's own sandbox, and in its
//! docs: from 2.1.285, `network.httpProxyPort` and `network.socksProxyPort` replace its own
//! proxy with the one listening there, and a port left out is still its own, so purlis names
//! both ([`Settings::through`]) or neither. Once they are set, the proxy decides every
//! connection, and Claude Code's allowed domains, its approval prompts and its check of local
//! addresses stop applying; purlis's proxy runs that check itself ([`super::reach`]). The
//! allowed domains are still written: Claude Code restricts a command's network only while
//! they are set. Its macOS profile then lets a command connect to those two loopback ports and
//! no other, **unless a settings source turns `allowLocalBinding` on**: that adds every loopback
//! port, every local service among them. So purlis names it `false`, never leaves it out,
//! which outranks a user's or a project's `true` (read in 2.1.296's settings merge: a `false`
//! in force wins; an administrator's settings still outrank purlis's). A Claude Code older
//! than 2.1.285 keeps its own proxy and the allowed domains, as before
//! ([`super::Applied::answered`]).
//!
//! **What a project's sandbox widens** (spec #1330, #1337). Read out of Claude Code 2.1.291's
//! own settings schema and its profile builder:
//! - `filesystem.allowWrite` is *"Additional paths to allow writing within the sandbox"*,
//!   absolute or `~`-expanded, a glob compiled to a regular expression. It carries the project's
//!   package caches ([`super::Widened::caches`]): each tool's folder and cargo's few files by
//!   path, and inside each of cargo's bare repositories by `<db>/*/**`, which never matches an
//!   entry itself. Each path by both names where a link stands in between; left out when there
//!   are none. Every `denyWrite` still wins inside them.
//! - Each folder purlis made is pinned: Claude Code denies `file-write-unlink` and
//!   `file-write-create` on every folder above a `denyWrite` entry, so a `.git` denied at each
//!   cache folder's top pins that folder, and a bare repository's `config` and `hooks` denied
//!   pin cargo's git database.
//! - `enableWeakerNetworkIsolation` is *"macOS only: Allow access to com.apple.trustd.agent in
//!   the sandbox. Needed for Go-based CLI tools (gh, gcloud, terraform, etc.) to verify TLS
//!   certificates"*; its profile adds exactly `(allow mach-lookup (global-name
//!   "com.apple.trustd.agent"))`. It is `true` only where the project's `certificate-checks` is
//!   (D-1337-7), and `false` otherwise, never left out, so a user's `true` does not merge in.
