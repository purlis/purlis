//! **The live ask** (#1666, spec #1661, decisions N-2, N-6, N-10): a chat's connection to a host
//! nothing lists is *held* while the person is asked, and goes on the moment they allow it, so
//! the command that made it carries on with nothing failing and nothing restarting.
//!
//! One [`Asks`] board stands beside each chat's proxy ([`super::egress`]), made when the chat
//! starts and gone when it ends. The proxy asks it of a connection whose decision is
//! [`super::reach::Decision::Ask`] ([`Asks::hold`]); the app answers it from the window alone
//! ([`Asks::allow`], [`Asks::keep_blocked`]), and nothing a connection carries is ever read as
//! an answer.
//!
//! - **Held, then allowed.** A held connection waits up to [`HOLD`]. An Allow at any scope wakes
//!   it, and it is carried as an Allowed host at that scope.
//! - **Held, then timed out.** Nobody answered within [`HOLD`]: the connection is refused as it
//!   was before purlis asked live, the timeout is told ([`Heard::TimedOut`]) so it is recorded,
//!   and the ask stays with the person. A later Allow applies at once, and answers the hosts that
//!   gave up, so the app tells the chat, in fixed words, to retry.
//! - **Grouped.** New hosts one chat reaches within [`GROUP`] of the first are one ask
//!   ([`Heard::Asked`]): told together once the window has passed, each host and port named
//!   whole as the proxy heard it, never a wildcard, so the person answers once.
//! - **Keep blocked** refuses what is held on that host now and what comes after, until an Allow.
//! - **Bounded.** At most [`MOST_HELD`] connections are held at once; one more is refused at
//!   once, as before, and not asked about ([`Answer::Busy`]).
//! - **Nobody to ask.** Where no Notice can be raised ([`Asks::asking_while`]: the project's
//!   hooks are not listening yet, or the chat has no number yet), a connection is refused at
//!   once, as before, and not held a minute for an ask nobody sees ([`Answer::NobodyToAsk`]).
