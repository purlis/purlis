//! purlis's loopback egress proxy (ADR 0067 §3 as amended 2026-10-10): what a harness purlis
//! wraps reaches the network through, where the harness has no proxy of its own.
//!
//! **One chat, one pair of ports** (#1664). Each chat purlis wraps gets its own proxy, made when
//! the chat starts and gone when it ends ([`Proxy`] stops listening when dropped): an HTTP port
//! ([`Proxy::port`]) and a SOCKS5 port ([`Proxy::socks_port`]). The wrap lets the chat connect to
//! those two ports on the loopback interface and nowhere else, so a program that ignores
//! `HTTPS_PROXY` reaches nothing, and one chat never reaches another's ports. **Which chat a
//! connection is from is which proxy it arrived on**: nothing a connection sends names a chat,
//! and nothing it sends is read as one.
//!
//! The HTTP port carries:
//!
//! - **`CONNECT host:443`**, the tunnel every HTTPS client asks a proxy for, to a listed host.
//!   The bytes inside the tunnel are the client's TLS, which the proxy does not read, so what
//!   host a TLS client names inside it (SNI) is the client's to say, as with any proxy that
//!   does not decrypt. There is no TLS interception and no certificate of purlis's own.
//! - **A plain request in absolute form** (`GET http://host/path`) to a listed host on port 80,
//!   sent on in origin form with `Connection: close`, so one connection reaches one host. Its
//!   one `Host` must name the same host, and its body must state its length: the body is
//!   carried and nothing after it, so a second request cannot ride the same connection.
//!
//! The SOCKS5 port carries a `CONNECT` with no authentication (RFC 1928), to a name or an
//! address, on the ports a tunnel is carried to. Every other method, command and address type
//! is refused with SOCKS's own reply.
//!
//! **The head is read strictly**, so the proxy and the host it reaches cannot read it two ways:
//! CRLF line ends only, one space between the request line's three parts, `HTTP/1.1` or
//! `HTTP/1.0`, header names of token characters with no space before the colon, no folded
//! header, at most one `Host` and one `Content-Length` (digits only), and no
//! `Transfer-Encoding`. A head that breaks any of these is refused.
//!
//! **What is carried is decided by the core decision module** ([`super::reach`]): by host and
//! port only, open, persona, allowed, ask or refused. Anything not carried is refused before a
//! connection is made: a host nothing lists (an ask, held while the person is asked where the
//! chat's proxy has a board of live asks, [`super::asks`], #1666, and refused where it has
//! none or nobody answered in time), a tunnel to any port but 443, a plain request to any port but 80, and
//! a request that is not one of the two above.
//!
//! **Bounded** ([`Limits`]): at most a few connections at once are served, over both ports
//! together; a head or a SOCKS greeting must arrive whole within a deadline; a connection that
//! carries nothing either way for long is closed; a write the other side does not take in that
//! time ends it; and a failing accept backs off rather than spinning. No buffer grows past a
//! fixed size.
//!
//! **The local-address check.** The proxy resolves each name itself, and a name is reached only
//! at the addresses it resolves to that a chat may reach ([`reachable`]): never this machine, a
//! link-local, multicast or broadcast address, or a cloud metadata service, checked at every
//! connect, so a name that resolves or is rebound there reaches nothing. A name that resolves
//! *only* there is refused as a Block. An address literal is held to the same check: the one
//! exception is that exact address and port, listed ([`super::reach::Reach::lists_exactly`]).
//! A listed name is a name, so an address literal is never carried unless a preset or a host
//! lists it, and a wildcard never matches one.
//!
//! **A host listed with a port** (`10.0.0.5:6443`, a project's or a person's, #1341) is carried
//! on that port alone, tunnel or plain; a host without one on the ports above.
//!
//! **What it refused is its own record** ([`Refusals`]): each host and port it refused because
//! no preset or host lists it, as the request named them, once each and at most
//! [`REFUSALS_KEPT`]. A brokered `secret exec` reads it to tell the asking chat which host its
//! command was refused (`crate::secrets::brokered`), and the app raises the chat's Block from
//! it: the proxy's word, never the command's.
//!
//! **Every connection is told** ([`Reached`]): each connection carried or refused, by host and
//! port and the decision's word, coalesced to a line per host and port a minute ([`Tally`]), so
//! the app keeps every connection in the network record without a chat being able to flood it.
