//! charter's alert rows — a port of `charter/statusline.py`'s `_alerts` and the
//! `_plane_root_alert` it ends on.
//!
//! # What an alert is
//!
//! Not telemetry: an **actionable problem with the control plane**, carrying the command that
//! fixes it, and rendered only when it is real — so a healthy plane costs no rows. charter has
//! five, always in this order:
//!
//! 1. **the pin** — `[charter] version` beside `[update] channel = "dev"` (two different
//!    charters asked for at once), or a pin the running charter does not meet;
//! 2. **the front door** — `[persona] default` naming a persona that is not there;
//! 3. **reinit** — how many OTHER workspaces are behind the current layout (the active one is the
//!    identity row's to flag, so the two surfaces never both say it);
//! 4. **a nested plane** — `$CHARTER_ROOT` pinned this session inside a plane that another
//!    plane's `workspaces/` holds, so memory and vaults go to the inner one;
//! 5. **the plane root** — the root being worked in: tracked changes, a detached HEAD, a branch
//!    that is not its default, a memory commit that never reached `origin`.
//!
//! # Structured here, worded twice
//!
//! charter builds each row as an ANSI string where it decides it. This port keeps the decision
//! and the words apart: [`read`] answers with [`Alert`] values, [`Alert::line`] draws the row the
//! terminal status line prints — byte for byte what charter prints, which the
//! `statusline-alerts-*` differential scenarios compare — and [`Alert::shown`] gives the app the
//! same facts as plain words for its Inbox. Two renderings of ONE decision, so the Inbox and
//! the status line cannot come to different answers about whether there is anything to say.
//!
//! # A reading that stopped is not an empty one
//!
//! charter's `_alerts` has ONE guard: an exception anywhere drops every row after it and keeps
//! the rows already made. The terminal cannot say that happened, and charter's status line does
//! not try. **The port keeps the fact** — [`Reading::stopped`] says why the reading ended early —
//! because the app draws a COUNT, and a count taken from a reading that stopped halfway is a
//! smaller number than the truth with nothing on it saying so. `footer.rs`'s rule: a number
//! charter cannot stand behind is dropped, never shown.
//!
//! # The decided differences
//!
//! Both are in the pin row, and both come from what a version is here (ADR 0030, as amended by
//! ADR 0045):
//!
//! - **Which pins draw it.** The row asks `adopt::pin_verdict` — the one comparison every
//!   surface asks — and draws only on drift. A pin on the Python charter's line (0.62.1 and
//!   below, not this app's version) is an older charter line, not drift, so it draws nothing
//!   where the Python charter draws its row.
//! - **What it says.** The running number is the app's version, and the row ends `· charter
//!   version` where the Python charter's ends `· charter version sync`: that verb installs the
//!   pinned charter, and this binary answers it with a refusal that points at `charter version`
//!   (`adopt::version_move_refusal`).
//!
//! The recorded `statusline-*` scenarios carry the second as the app's own row (it was
//! `PIN_ROW_REMEDY` in the differential, ADR 0046) and compare every other byte of it; the first is `alerts/tests.rs`'s, because the
//! Python side draws a row the harness would have to count differently.
