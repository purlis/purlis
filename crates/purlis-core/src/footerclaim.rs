//! Who already fills Claude Code's status line here — and therefore whether charter may.
//!
//! # The measurement this module exists for
//!
//! A `statusLine` handed to Claude Code through `--settings` **is executed and rendered**, and
//! it **shadows** every other one: measured on Claude Code 2.1.280 (macOS, a real pty, a fenced
//! `HOME`) as a four-cell matrix, one launch per cell. With a `statusLine` in
//! `~/.claude/settings.json` AND one on the flag, only the flag's ran — the file's proof file
//! was never created, and nothing warned. Claude Code's own settings reference says why:
//! settings merge key by key, the highest level that sets a key supplies it whole, and
//! `statusLine` is on none of the merge-exception lists. The flag sits above user, project and
//! project-local settings, so it is simply the last writer.
//!
//! So arming charter's own footer command unconditionally would stop the operator's own
//! `statusLine` from running, for every chat the app starts, silently. That is a change to how
//! their machine behaves, made without asking.
//!
//! # The rule, which the operator gave on 2026-09-22
//!
//! **charter arms its `statusLine` only where nothing else fills the line. Where something
//! does, charter arms nothing and leaves their configuration alone** — and the cost, a chat
//! with no `ctx`/`cache` gauge, is reported by `doctor` rather than left to look like
//! breakage. His reason: silently replacing somebody's configuration is the worse failure, and
//! `doctor` exists so that a missing feature can explain itself.
//!
//! **And it fails toward leaving it alone.** A settings file that is there and cannot be read
//! or parsed answers [`Claim::Unknown`], which arms nothing: an unreadable file is not evidence
//! that the key is free. Neither is a file that turns every non-managed status line off
//! ([`Claim::Suppressed`]) — charter's own would be skipped there without a word, so arming it
//! would be charter claiming a gauge it cannot deliver.
//!
//! # What charter can see, and what it cannot
//!
//! Every source below is a FILE, which is what makes any of this answerable. Claude Code's
//! documented precedence has sources that are not files at all, and [`UNSEEN`] is the sentence
//! that says so wherever this answer is reported — because a green row that did not say it
//! would be claiming more than it looked at (ADR 0013).
//!
//! Read, highest precedence first:
//!
//! 1. the managed policy file and its `managed-settings.d/*.json` drop-ins, per operating
//!    system — `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode` on macOS, `/etc/claude-code` on Linux,
//!    `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode` on Windows (**not** the legacy `ProgramData` path, which
//!    Claude Code's docs say it does not read);
//! 2. `remote-settings.json` in the config folder — the local cache of what an organisation
//!    serves. A cache is not the authority, so what it holds is evidence and its absence is
//!    not;
//! 3. `.claude/settings.local.json`, which since 2.1.211 lives at the **git root**, and in a
//!    worktree at the **main checkout's** root — all three candidates are read, because reading
//!    one too many can only make charter more careful;
//! 4. `.claude/settings.json` in the session's own directory (the host does not walk up:
//!    measured for `doctor`'s `session layer` row on 2.1.259, re-measured on 2.1.267);
//! 5. `settings.json` in the config folder (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else `~/.claude`).
//!
//! Plugins are not on that list and do not need to be: a plugin's own `settings.json` may
//! carry `agent` and `subagentStatusLine` and nothing else, so no plugin can introduce the key
//! this module is about. `subagentStatusLine` is a different key, a different row, and not
//! charter's to fill.
