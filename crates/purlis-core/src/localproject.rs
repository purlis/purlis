//! This machine's local project, moved out of the config home into the data home (#1670).
//!
//! The first run used to make the local project in purlis's folder in the config home
//! (`<config>/local-plane`). A chat's sandbox denies writing that whole folder, because it holds
//! the person's own powers (ADR 0067 §5, class 3), so no sandboxed chat could start in a project
//! inside it. The local project is made in the data home now (`<data>/local-project`,
//! [`crate::firstrun::local_plane`]), where nothing a chat is denied sits above it, and a machine
//! that has one in the old place has it moved there at the app's next launch ([`at_launch`]).
//!
//! # How a move is made, and why no file is lost
//!
//! - **One rename**, so the project is whole in one place or the other, never split: a move
//!   across file systems is refused by the system, and the project is left where it is.
//! - **A pointer is left at the old place** (a link to the new one) the moment the rename is
//!   made, so anything that still names the old path finds the project.
//! - **Then what names the old path is pointed at the new one**: the git links between each clone
//!   and its worktrees, the record of the chats that were open, the records of its tasks (#1698),
//!   and this machine's remembered projects and windows.
//! - **The pointer goes only once every one of those is done** and the project reads as a
//!   project in its new place. Until then it stays, and the next launch finishes the rest.
//! - **A journal says a move was started** (`<config>/purlis/local-project-move`), written before
//!   the rename and taken away after the pointer, holding the folder's identity (its device and
//!   inode, which a rename keeps). A launch that died between the rename and the pointer finds
//!   the old place empty and the journal there: it puts the pointer back only when the folder in
//!   the new place is that same folder, and finishes. The approval and pin of the old place go to
//!   the new one only through the pointer or the journal, both in the config home a chat may not
//!   write, so they go only with the same files.
//! - **One launch at a time**: the move holds a lock beside the machine store for its whole
//!   length, so two launches never move or rewrite at once.
//! - **Nothing a chat wrote is followed.** The project's files are a chat's to write, so every
//!   file the move reads or rewrites in it is reached through no link and no `..`
//!   ([`crate::contain::no_link_on_the_way`]) and replaced whole ([`crate::rewrite::replace`]).
//!   A worktree outside the project, or a clone outside it whose worktree is inside, is never
//!   written: the pointer is kept and the log names the `git worktree repair` to run.
//!
//! # A chat's harness conversation
//!
//! A harness that keeps its conversations under the folder a chat ran in (Claude Code keeps
//! them in `~/.claude/projects/<the folder, spelled with dashes>/`) does not find a conversation
//! from the old place when the chat resumes in the new one, since the folder has another name.
//! Nothing is deleted: the conversation's file stays where the harness wrote it. A resume that
//! is not found starts the chat fresh with its session record in its briefing, as any lost
//! conversation does ([`crate::sessionresume::NotResumed::HarnessLostIt`]). Keeping the pointer
//! would not help: a chat started at the old spelling runs in the folder the system resolves,
//! the new one, and the old spelling is inside the config home a sandbox refuses.
//!
//! # What is never moved
//!
//! - A project something works in: a purlis window holding it, or any process of this user whose
//!   working folder is inside it. It is left where it is, and the launch says so once
//!   ([`Moved::Left`]). It moves at a later launch, once nothing works in it.
//! - A project whose new place is taken: two folders are never merged.
//! - A project whose new place would be inside a repository, a project, or the config home.
