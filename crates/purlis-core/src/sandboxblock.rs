//! **A sandbox block, sorted** (#1338, spec #1330): what a sandboxed chat's sandbox refused, read
//! from the harness's own report of it, reduced to an operation and the kind of path or host it
//! was about — and nothing else.
//!
//! # Only a sandboxed chat, and the sandbox's own evidence first
//!
//! A tool hook runs outside the chat's sandbox, after the tool came back. It reads anything only
//! in a chat the app started sandboxed (`crate::sandbox::chat_is_sandboxed`): a refusal in a chat
//! that opted out, or by macOS's privacy controls or system integrity protection, is not the
//! sandbox's, and is never shown as one. Then ([`detect`]):
//!
//! - **Claude Code's `<sandbox_violations>` block**, the primary signal: one Seatbelt line per
//!   refusal, `cargo(123) deny(1) file-write-create /path`. Only the last block, and only when it
//!   ends the text, which is where Claude Code appends it. A connection Claude Code's proxy
//!   refused is said there in the proxy's own shape, with no process: `deny network-outbound
//!   host:443 (reason)` (#1631). It names the host to allow, and each host refused is its own
//!   block.
//! - **An egress proxy's refusal**: purlis's own ("purlis's sandbox does not allow host:443"),
//!   Claude Code's ("blocked by network allowlist"), or a client's word for the `403` a proxy
//!   answered a tunnel with; and Go's certificate check failing on the system service the
//!   sandbox keeps from it (`x509: OSStatus -26276`). A lookup the sandbox refused a program
//!   that resolves a host itself, past the proxy (macOS's "nodename nor servname provided",
//!   curl's "Could not resolve host"), and a local socket Docker's client or Go's dial was
//!   refused (#1631): neither comes with a violation line.
//! - **A program's own "Operation not permitted"** that names its path, where no violation block
//!   said more, and only for a path outside what the chat may write (its folder and the temporary
//!   folders): inside them, the sandbox did not refuse it.
//!
//! The last two are read from a command's **standard error** (`PostToolUse`'s
//! `tool_response.stderr`) wherever they are on a line. **A refusal of the network is read from
//! standard output too** (#1663): a command run with `2>&1`, a failed command's `error` (which
//! holds both streams), and a background command's output file a chat reads back with `cat`.
//! There a line counts only when it ends where the refusal's own words do
//! ([`ends_as_a_refusal`]), so a file that quotes them (a test's source, a log about one, a grep
//! through this module) is not refused anything; and a program's own refusal of a path is never
//! read there at all.
//!
//! **What a command printed on standard output never names a host to allow**: a file or a
//! server's page can say any host. A refused lookup names the host the program said it looked
//! up, from either stream ([`detect_with_targets`]): it is shown, and never offered to allow,
//! since a host the project allows would not let such a program through.
//!
//! **Each harness's adapter hands its result over in that shape** (#1353). opencode returns a
//! shell command's standard output and error as one text, with its exit status beside it. Its
//! shim (`crate::opencode`) passes a command that did not fail as one mixed text, so only a
//! violation block is read from it. A command that failed is passed as standard error marked
//! `mixed`, and all three kinds of evidence are read from it, standard output included, which is
//! wider than Claude Code's route: a failing command that prints a refusal's words raises a
//! block. So from a mixed stream nothing but a violation line names a target for a grant
//! ([`detect_with_targets`]): such a Notice names no host or path, and the person types it.
//! Codex arms no hook after a command. A chat of either runs behind purlis's own proxy
//! (`crate::sandbox::egress`), which tells the app each host it refused by name, as a brokered
//! run's does; their hook leaves a refused host to it ([`the_proxy_tells_hosts`]), so one
//! refusal is one Notice.
//!
//! # Whose operation it was
//!
//! **Per violation line, by the process it names**: a line whose process is `purlis` (or a name
//! it is installed under) is purlis's own, which is a purlis bug. Nothing else is: a line with no
//! process, a proxy's refusal, a program's own words. So `cargo build; purlis status` does not
//! make cargo's block purlis's. A chat can still print a line that names `purlis`, as it can
//! send the app any line its token admits; what that buys is a Notice on its own tab and one
//! more in the count ([`Throttle`] bounds it), and a Report that names only fixed words.
//!
//! # What is kept of it
//!
//! **An operation, a kind, and whether it was purlis's own** ([`Block`]). A path is read here,
//! in the hook, to sort it, and goes no further than the Notice's Allow: no path, argument or
//! output is kept. **The host travels** (#1663, settling #1353): the host a refused connection
//! or lookup named goes to the app on the block's line ([`detect_with_targets`]), and is kept
//! with the block, checked as a grant checks a host ([`named_host`]): a refused connection's as
//! the host Allow may name, a refused lookup's as one never offered to allow
//! ([`record::Entry::looked_up`]).
//!
//! The app keeps each block it hears in this machine's network record ([`record`], #1662) for
//! 30 days, with the chat it came from and, for a refused connection, the host and port. That
//! is what `purlis doctor` counts ([`record::counts`]), Settings' Network page and a chat's
//! Network view list, and the window shows it as a notice on the chat's tab.
//! A block of purlis's own is a purlis bug, and the notice offers a Report whose draft is made
//! from the block alone (`report::Draft::of_sandbox_block`). Nothing is sent without a press.
