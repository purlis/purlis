//! **A chat's timeline and the fleet counts are queries of the event log** (R-223, Q129, Q216):
//! the timeline the Chat log tab draws, and the counts of each kind of stop, per chat and across
//! chats, that the marker and the finish rows read.
//!
//! **No second write path.** Both are read from the one log through its read API
//! ([`super::read`]), and neither keeps anything of its own: an event the log gains shows in
//! both, and one it no longer holds shows in neither. Nothing is migrated: the shipped Activity
//! view ([`crate::activity`]) is still read from the dispatch records, with the chats' own words,
//! and the event log stays metadata-only.
//!
//! **A new kind of story event needs a line in [`is_story`].** Only `trust.*` is taken as a
//! family; `run.started`, `run.ended` and the four kinds of stop ([`stops`]: `stop.block`,
//! `stop.hold`, `stop.loop_pause` and `ask.answered`) are taken by name. Any other kind, a new
//! `stop.*` or `run.*` one included, and one outside those families such as an ask being raised,
//! is left out of the timeline until [`is_story`] names it, and a new kind of stop is counted
//! only once [`Tally`] has a bucket for it.
