//! How one operator likes their window: **the layout and the theme, each a file beside
//! `machine.json`** in charter's own config directory.
//!
//! Both are "how one operator likes their window" rather than facts about a plane — the
//! argument ADR 0040 made for pins — so neither is committed to `charter.toml`, where it
//! would arrive with every clone and rearrange or repaint somebody else's window. And neither is
//! a field of the machine store: [`crate::machine`] keeps five things and says the count is
//! load-bearing, and a region arrangement or a colour names nothing that store holds.
//!
//! **Files, because a file is the one form an operator can hand-edit** (M6.9). A layout's `side`
//! and `order` have no control in the window yet, so until one exists the file is the only way
//! to reach them; `docs/design-system.md` documents both formats for exactly that reader.
//!
//! **Read before the window exists, and handed to it at creation.** A webview answers a Tauri
//! command asynchronously, so a layout fetched *from* the window lands after the first paint:
//! the default arrangement is painted and then re-laid-out, which is the flash
//! charter-app#141 left and ADR 0038 removed. So `app/src-tauri` reads both files here, before
//! the window is built, and puts what it read into the page with the window's initialization
//! script. The first frame has it; nothing is fetched.
//!
//! # What this module decides, and what it leaves to the window
//!
//! The **envelope** is decided here: the file is a JSON object, and a layout says which version
//! of the format it is and holds a `regions` array. A file that fails any of that is not in
//! force and the reason travels with the reading ([`Reading::trouble`]), so the window can put
//! it where purlis says such things — the Inbox — rather than in a console nobody
//! reads.
//!
//! **What a region or a token means is the window's**, because the vocabulary is: the regions
//! are `app/src/regions.ts`'s catalogue and the tokens are `app/src/theme/theme.ts`'s. Both of
//! those `load` functions take whatever this module hands them, fall back field by field and
//! say what they put right. A second copy of either vocabulary here would be a second answer to
//! "which regions exist", and the first one to drift would be the one nobody runs.
//!
//! # Everything read back is attacker-influenced
//!
//! The same rule as the store beside it, and the same read: [`crate::machine::read_beside`] —
//! no link on the way or at the leaf, a plain file asked of the open descriptor, a size bound,
//! `O_NONBLOCK` — because this read happens before there is a window, and a FIFO or a planted
//! giant here is a launch that never finishes. The theme's values are additionally held to a
//! hex grammar by `theme.ts`, which is what stands between a theme file and a stylesheet.
