//! Where a persona chat works: the asking chat's folder, another workspace, or a worktree of
//! its own on a branch of its own (#1453, spec #1434).
//!
//! A dispatch may say where with `--in`: `workspace:<name>` for another workspace of the
//! project, or `worktree` for a new worktree of the repo the asking chat works in. With
//! neither, the persona's own `dispatch-isolation: worktree` is its default, and without that
//! the chat works where the asking chat does.
//!
//! # What the ask chooses, and what it never does
//!
//! **A word, and nothing else.** The ask says `worktree`, or a workspace's name. It names no
//! folder, no repo and no branch: there is no field to name one in. Which repo a worktree is
//! cut from is the app's own record of where the asking chat stands ([`repo_of`]); what the
//! worktree's folder and branch are called is purlis's ([`piece_name`]), from the task's name
//! and the dispatch's own id, so two worktree tasks never share either; and a workspace is
//! looked up among the ones the project has, reached through no link ([`workspace_folder`]).
//!
//! # A worktree's life
//!
//! The app cuts it, never the chat, and by the brokered route
//! ([`crate::gitbroker::in_a_checked_clone`]): a sandboxed chat may not write a clone's
//! `.git`, and git run for it reads no configuration it could have shaped. The persona chat
//! starts in it and commits on its branch. **purlis merges nothing for it by itself, and no
//! chat can have purlis merge it.** The report names the branch from the dispatch's record, which
//! the app wrote.
//!
//! It goes one of three ways, and the first two are the person's own acts, from the window
//! (#1511). The person merges its branch into the branch it was cut from ([`merge_asked`],
//! [`merge`]): a fast-forward or nothing, of the commit they were shown, so a merge that does
//! not apply cleanly changes nothing and says why. The person discards its folder, after
//! being shown what goes with it ([`at_risk`], [`discard`]); its branch stays unless git finds
//! it merged, so no commit is lost by a discard (ADR 0072 §4: deleting a branch that holds
//! work is never purlis's act). Or purlis finds its branch merged and takes it away itself
//! ([`tidy`]): asked when its chat closes, when the project is opened and after the person's
//! merge, never on a timer, and only by git's safe removal, which leaves a folder holding
//! anything uncommitted exactly where it is.
