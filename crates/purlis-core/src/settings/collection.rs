//! **The collection write seam** (ST-3, the spec on #1221, V91e–g and V91l): how a Settings
//! collection — a list of entries in a settings file, such as `[[forge]]` blocks or
//! `[harness.<name>]` profiles — is added to and taken from.
//!
//! **One module per collection, three functions each**, shared by every caller (the window today,
//! the CLI when it gains the words):
//!
//! - `listed(text) -> Vec<Listed>` lists the entries a file holds, each with an **opaque
//!   identity** ([`Listed::id`]), its label, where its keys are, and the Add form's values that
//!   would write it again;
//! - `add(root, base, &Entry) -> Result<String, Refusal>` checks the **whole entry**, writes it
//!   to the collection's home file and answers the new entry's identity;
//! - `remove(root, base, id) -> Result<Entry, Refusal>` takes the entry called `id` out, **unless
//!   something uses it**: then nothing is written and the refusal names each user. Nothing
//!   cascades. It answers the entry it removed, as `add` takes it.
//!
//! **`base` is the text the entries were drawn from** — the file as the caller read it when the
//! person pressed Add or Remove, never as it stands when the write runs — exactly as
//! [`super::save`] takes it: a file changed on disk since is refused rather than written over,
//! and an identity is looked up in `base`, so a remove can never land on another entry. Every
//! write ends in [`super::save`], so a new entry is also refused for whatever the next read of the
//! file would refuse, in that reader's words, and for a secret — the collection adds rules only a
//! writer can break (a duplicate, one host declared as two kinds) and never repeats a reader's.
//!
//! **A refusal has three parts** ([`Refusal`]), so the window can put each sentence where it
//! belongs: [`Refusal::fields`] under the field of the Add form it is about (the field's name is
//! the entry's own key: `kind`, `host`), [`Refusal::referrers`] under the entry a Remove was
//! refused for, each with the Settings group it is changed in when it is a setting, and
//! [`Refusal::file`] for the whole write (the file moved, a secret, a file a form cannot edit).
//!
//! **Undo** (D-ST3-i, as amended by the dispatcher): the Undo of an add is the inverse
//! operation through these same functions — a `remove` of the identity `add` answered, with its
//! reference check, so it is refused once something uses the entry (a repo catalogued on the
//! host since, say). The Undo of a remove is **the file's earlier text written back exactly**,
//! through [`super::save`] against the text the remove left: the entry returns to its place, as
//! it was spelled, with its comment — and order matters, since a plane's first `[[forge]]` block
//! is its primary group. It asks no reference check, because putting an entry back only declares
//! again and cannot take anything away from a user; it is refused if the file moved since. A
//! collection with no text to put back (the machine store) undoes a remove with an `add`.
//!
//! [`super::forges`] is the first collection. A new one copies its shape: an `Entry` with one
//! `String`/`Vec<String>` per form field, `check` for the field refusals, `listed`, `add`,
//! `remove`, and a `referrers` that says who uses an entry.
