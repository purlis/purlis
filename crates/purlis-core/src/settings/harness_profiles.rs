//! **Harness profiles, as a Settings collection** (ST-4, #1236): the `[harness.<name>]` tables
//! of the project's local settings file, added, removed and renamed through the collection
//! write seam ([`super::collection`]).
//!
//! A profile is what [`crate::profiles`] reads: a `kind`, a `command` (a list of arguments, no
//! shell) and an optional `env`. The Add form asks for the name, the kind and the command; the
//! environment is set on the profile's own page once it is there, one variable per line.
//!
//! **One set of rules.** A new entry is checked by the loader's own rules
//! ([`crate::profiles::refusals_of`] and [`crate::profiles::launch_refusals`]), each said under
//! the field it is about, in the words the next read would use — plus the two only a writer can
//! break: a name the file already has, and a value shaped like a secret, which a profile never
//! holds (V91m) and which is refused under its field with a pointer to the vault.
//!
//! **What uses a profile** ([`referrers`]) is a `[harness] default` that names it, in either
//! settings file — but only when the name would then name nothing: a table that replaces a
//! built-in (`[harness.claude]`) leaves the built-in standing, so the default still starts a
//! chat. A chat's record names its profile too, and is not a user here: a reopened chat whose
//! profile is gone is skipped by name (ADR 0022), never started on another.
//!
//! **Rename** (V91k) is allowed only while nothing uses the profile, and is refused naming who
//! does, as a remove is — each user saying whether it [`Referrer::follows`] a rename everywhere,
//! so the refusal is what the window shows before anything changes. **A rename everywhere**
//! ([`rename_everywhere`], #1380) renames the profile and the local file's own default that names
//! it in one write of that one file, so a failure leaves nothing half-renamed. The project's
//! default does not follow: it is every teammate's, and a rename on this machine never rewrites
//! it — while it names the profile, the rename is refused either way. A renamed profile is one no
//! approval names, so its first run asks again, as a new one's does ([`crate::profiletrust`]).
