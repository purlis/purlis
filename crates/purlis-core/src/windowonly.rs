//! **A refusal whose only way out is a press in the window raises an ask** (R-328, Q181): no
//! window-only dead end.
//!
//! Where purlis refuses a chat something only the person's press in the window can change, the
//! refusal is raised here as an ask carrying that [`Control`], for the app to list in Asks; the
//! chat is told the ask was raised and what it is called, never "from the window" alone. Each
//! chat raises one ask per control, however often it is refused. The person's press clears it
//! ([`trust_this_clone`]), for every chat that waits on it, and so does their press on the
//! control's own Notice, which is the same act. An ask is raised whatever became of that Notice:
//! one the person dismissed comes back here as an ask once its condition stops a chat (R-335).
//!
//! The first refusal is a GitHub App token that can't be minted for a clone purlis has no record
//! of ([`crate::forge::apptoken::token_for`], R-330), whose control is **Trust this clone**.
//!
//! The refusals are kept in memory alone, by project, as the tokens they stand in for are
//! ([`crate::forge::apptoken`]): they are this run's, and a chat's go when it ends
//! ([`forget`]).
