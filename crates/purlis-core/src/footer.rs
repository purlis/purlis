//! charter's read surface, rendered as one block of text — a port of `charter/statusline.py`'s

//!
//! # What this draws, and where the seam is

//! charter's footer is three zones and a frame around them:
//!

//! └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! **This build draws zone 1, the alert rows and the frame, and says in the body what it does
//! not draw.** The alert rows are [`crate::alerts`], compared row for row by the
//! `statusline-alerts-*` differential scenarios. The
//! seam is the zone rule, which is charter's own divider and not one invented for the port:
//! everything above it — the top border, the identity row and the rule itself — is byte for
//! byte what charter prints, and the recorded scenarios compare exactly that
//! (`statusline-*identity-row*`, cut at the rule, ADR 0046).
//!
//! Why a seam at all: zone 2 is a `git status` per clone, linked worktrees drawn as rows,
//! persona chips with vault health and memory counts, and the row planner that
//! decides what a narrow pane gives up — and zone 3 is the usage history and the update cache.
//! They are ports of their own. What this milestone refuses to do is draw *some* of zone 2: a
//! footer that silently omitted the alert row would be worse than a sentence, because an
//! operator reads a footer to find out whether anything needs them, and one that can only ever
//! say "nothing" is a footer that lies once a week. So the omission is a line
//! ([`NOT_DRAWN_YET`]) rather than an absence.
//!
//! # The one rule the identity row is composed by
//!
//! **A count lives next to the thing it counts.** The todos are the active workspace's, so
//! they sit beside its name; the piece counts are that workspace's worktrees; `ws N` is how
//! many others there are to switch to. Nothing here describes a repo, a persona or this
//! session — those are the zones below.
//!
//! **Zero renders NOTHING.** A `todo 0` present every turn is furniture within a day, and then
//! a real `todo 7` in that spot draws no more attention than the zero did. Presence is the
//! signal, and it is why `todo`, the piece cell and the reinit tip are each dropped entirely
//! rather than rendered empty.
//!
//! **The row's order IS its truncation order**, and a warning outranks information: on a pane
//! wide enough for the reinit tip or the todo count but not both, the item naming a broken
//! structure is the one that survives.
//!
//! # Never crash
//!
//! `charter/statusline.py` promises its render never raises, and every helper it calls
//! swallows its own failure to keep that promise. Nothing here returns a `Result` for the same
//! reason: a footer that vanished is worse than one that shows less.

///    two answers differ only for a workspace that carries such a link AND is missing the file
///    under it — a plane where the footer would be flagging a repair that charter would not.
/// 3. charter reads a stamp it cannot open as version 0, so a workspace it cannot read is
///    "behind". Here it is not behind (#1289). No recorded row has a workspace it cannot read,
