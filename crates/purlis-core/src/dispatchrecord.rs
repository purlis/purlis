//! The dispatch record: one file for each dispatch, kept by the app (#1452, spec #1434).
//!
//! A **dispatch** is one chat starting another: a task, which reports back, or a handoff, where
//! the work moves. Each leaves one record of who asked, which persona it went to, where it
//! worked, the brief, the report, when it started and ended, how often it needed the person,
//! and what its harness said it cost.
//!
//! # Where it lives, and why not in the dispatch log
//!
//! `<state>/app/dispatches/<id>.json`, one file a dispatch, in the app's own state
//! ([`crate::names::state`]): **Clone state, never committed**. A brief and a report are a
//! chat's words about the work, and can hold whatever the work held, so they stay on this
//! machine. The committed dispatch log (`personas/_dispatch/`, [`crate::dispatch`]) keeps its
//! handoff row of four fields, and names nothing this record holds. `purlis persona stats`
//! counts a persona's dispatches from both ([`tally`]).
//!
//! **Kept from git, and from the project's sandboxed chats** (D-1452-11). A sandboxed chat can
//! neither read nor write the store: [`crate::sandbox`] denies it for both, as it denies the
//! hook spool, so a brief or a report written for one persona is not readable by a chat
//! running as another. A chat gets its own dispatch's report on the delivery path and its own
//! list from the app's answer, never from the file. Nothing a chat runs reads it: the readers
//! are the app and the sweep the app runs when it opens a project. **Where there is no
//! sandbox** (a project without one, a chat started without it) only the file's mode holds,
//! and that keeps out other users of the machine, not the person's own chats.
//!
//! It is kept the way a chat's per-session files are ([`crate::retention`]): 30 days after its
//! dispatch ended, or after it was last written where it has not ended ([`aged_from`]), it is
//! collected when the project is opened, unless the chat that asked or the chat that worked is
//! one the reopen record brings back. A chat is matched by its ULID ([`same_chat`]): a number
//! is dealt again in another launch, and keeps nothing.
//!
//! # Who writes it
//!
//! **The app, and nothing else.** [`open`], [`note`], [`said`] and [`close`] are called by the
//! app with facts from its own record of the chats: no line on the hook channel names a
//! record, an asker, an outcome or a cost. Three things in a record are still a chat's. The
//! brief, the report's text and each message the two chats sent each other ([`Said`], #1495)
//! are its words, stored as written and held to a cap ([`cut`]). And what its
//! harness reported of tokens and cost ([`crate::usage::spent`]) is relayed by the chat's
//! status line, which its harness runs outside the sandbox, into a file of the app's folder
//! kept by the chat's id, where no sandboxed chat can write (#1457). It is shown as the harness
//! reported it, absent where the harness reports none, and never a zero.
//!
//! **One other file lives in the store**: what was refused while nobody was there
//! ([`crate::dispatchaway`]), kept here because this is the folder a sandboxed chat can
//! neither read nor write. It is not a record: its name is no ULID, so nothing below reads,
//! lists or collects it.
//!
//! A record is one JSON object, written whole and private ([`crate::rewrite::replace`]) under
//! purlis's lock on the directory. A closed record takes no further report: the first
//! [`close`] is the dispatch's end.
//!
//! # What is read back
//!
//! The store is the app's to write, and a file in it is still whatever is on the disk. So a
//! record is put on the screen only where it reads as one the app would have written
//! ([`sound`], [`drawn`]): refused and counted otherwise, never tidied and shown.
