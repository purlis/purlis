//! The first run: what a new machine has, and a plane nobody was asked about (FR-4, #603).
//!
//! Decision G5 asks for a first run that reaches a working chat in five minutes, and W10 says
//! how: **never ask where the plane goes.** A machine with no project gets a local plane in
//! charter's own directory, with no remote. Sharing it with a team comes later. The one thing
//! the first run asks for is the repo to work on, and that repo becomes a
//! workspace named after it, so the first chat starts there and not at the plane root.
//!
//! Three pieces, each a seam of its own:
//!
//! - [`local_plane`] and [`ensure_local_plane`]: where the plane lives, and making it.
//! - [`take_in`]: a repo cloned into a workspace of its own name, and [`take_in_from`]: the
//!   same, with the project laid out from a project template first (FR-17). The project then
//!   tracks the forge the repo's `origin` is on, added when it did not ([`ForgeTaken`], #880).
//! - [`harnesses`]: which harnesses are installed and whether each has been signed in to.
//!
//! # Where the local plane lives
//!
//! In purlis's data home (`$PURLIS_DATA_HOME`, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/purlis`, else the OS data
//! directory's `purlis/`, [`crate::datahome`]), as `local-project/`. **Never in the config
//! home**: a chat's sandbox denies writing the config home whole, because it holds the person's
//! own approvals (ADR 0067 §5, class 3), so no sandboxed chat could start in a project there
//! (#1670). The data home is the Machine tier's home for what is too large or too long-lived for
//! the config home (ADR 0069 §1 as ADR 0075 amends it), and nothing a chat is denied sits above
//! a folder in it. A machine whose local project is still in the config home
//! (`<config>/local-plane`) has it moved at the app's next launch ([`crate::localproject`]).
//!
//! The plane itself is in the **Plane** tier: its files are in its own git. With no remote,
//! that tier's usual backup does not exist for it, which is FR-10's to cover
//! (`docs/plane-format.md`).
//!
//! # Nothing here signs anybody in, and no credential is read
//!
//! [`harnesses`] asks whether a sign-in is there. It never starts one and never runs the
//! harness. **A credential file is asked about by its size alone**, never opened: a harness's
//! `auth.json` or `.credentials.json` is a secret. An API key in the environment is asked
//! whether it is set, not what it says. The one file that is read is Claude Code's
//! `~/.claude.json`, which is its settings and not a credential (on macOS the credential is in
//! the keychain): charter parses it only to see whether an `oauthAccount` object is there. A
//! harness that is installed and not signed in still starts: its own login is in its own first
//! screen, which is where W10 puts it.
