//! **The network record** (#1662, spec #1661): one record per machine of every **Block** the app
//! heard and every **Allowed host** a person added or removed, kept 30 days in purlis's data home
//! and never in a project, so it is never committed and never sent.
//!
//! It also keeps **every connection** purlis's own proxy carried or refused for a chat (#1664):
//! the host and port, the decision (its `scope`: `open`, `persona`, `you`, `chat` or `project`
//! for one let through, `ask` or `refused` for one refused) and how many connections the line stands for, coalesced by the proxy to a line per host and port a
//! minute (`sandbox::egress::Tally`), so a chat cannot turn the record over by connecting.
//!
//! It is the block store of #1338, moved out of the project's state folder and widened: where
//! that kept an operation and a kind for `purlis doctor`'s count, a line here also says which
//! chat it was (its id, its name and its number), the chat's persona, the host and port a
//! refused connection was to, and, for an Allow or its removal, what was allowed, at which
//! scope, who decided and the outcome. Settings' Network page, a chat's Network view and
//! `purlis doctor` read it; nothing decides what a chat may reach from it.
//!
//! # What is never kept
//!
//! A refused path, a command, its arguments or its output. A Block names a host only for a
//! refused connection (the host its Notice offered to allow) or a refused lookup (the host a
//! program said it looked up, never offered), and only what passes the check a grant makes of a
//! host ([`super::named_host`]), so a line a chat wrote cannot put anything else here. What a chat sends is still data: its
//! chat's name is what the person called it, and a host it names may be one it never tried.
//!
//! # Where and how
//!
//! `<data>/network/<project key>.jsonl` (the key is the digest the sandbox's cache homes are
//! named by, `sandbox::Homes::project_key`), one JSON line per event, appended. A write lets
//! go of what is older than [`KEPT_FOR_SECS`] and past [`AT_MOST_KEPT`] by rewriting the file
//! whole, under a lock on its folder. The file is 0600. A line this build cannot read, such as
//! an event word a newer build added, is kept and passed over. A sandboxed chat cannot write it:
//! purlis's data home is outside what a chat may write, but for the caches it is pointed at.
