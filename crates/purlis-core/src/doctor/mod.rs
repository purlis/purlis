//! `charter doctor`: the preflight an operator runs, and every harness runs at session start.
//!
//! A port of `charter/doctor.py` and `commands.cmd_doctor`. Each check is one [`Row`] — a
//! name, a status, a sentence and a repair — and `--json` prints them in exactly the shape
//! Python's `json.dumps(indent=2)` does, because other tools read that output and it is a
//! contract (the recorded `doctor-*` scenarios hold it byte for byte, ADR 0046).
//!
//! # An absent answer is not health
//!
//! The one rule every row here keeps, and the reason this module exists in the shape it has.
//! Python states it as `tests/test_doctor_absent_is_not_health.py`: a check that could not
//! run says so, WARN and never OK, because a green glyph over "charter did not look" is read
//! as "charter looked and it is fine" by anyone scanning the column.
//!
//! **That rule is also what decided how the checks this build does not run appear.** About half of
//! Python's rows were about parts this binary did not own when it was rebuilt — the guard and the
//! vaults (M3), the forges, the tmux frame, the Claude Code plugin. The ones still not checked are
//! planned in OB-8 (#994) and, for the forges, FG-2 (#802). Dropping those rows would be the
//! loudest possible violation: a doctor that stops reporting a problem reads as the problem being
//! fixed. So every one of them is still here, under its own name and in its own place, as a WARN
//! that says it was not checked and why ([`deferred`]). The differential test holds the list of
//! them, so a row that becomes ported has to say so there.
