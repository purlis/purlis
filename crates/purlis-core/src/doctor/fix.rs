//! **The fix registry** (FX-1, V91d, V91p): the doctor findings charter can fix itself, each
//! under one **fix id**, and the one entry point that applies a fix by that id.
//!
//! A row that charter can fix carries its id ([`super::Row::fix`]). `charter doctor --fix
//! [<id>]` and the Doctor dialog's Fix button both call [`apply`], so a fix is written once and
//! the terminal and the window can never disagree about what it does.
//!
//! # What is never a fix
//!
//! **Removing a git index lock** (V91p). Charter's rule is that it never removes a lock: a lock
//! that looks crashed can belong to a git that is still writing, and deleting it is how an
//! index is corrupted. The `index lock` row says how to check and leaves the removal to the
//! operator, so it carries no id, and no id here could name it.
//!
//! # What a fix answers
//!
//! What it changed, line by line, or why it refused ([`Fixed`]). A refusal is decided before
//! anything is written: a fix on a project this charter may not write (FR-24), or where there
//! is no project, writes nothing and says why. `plugin-install` is the one fix that writes no
//! project file, so it is the one that runs with no project too.
//!
//! # No fix removes or replaces your content
//!
//! Each id's doc below says exactly what it writes. A fix adds what is missing, or rewrites or
//! removes a file charter generates and owns; it never deletes a line or a file you wrote. The one fix
//! that takes a line out, `handoff-rule`, takes out a line `purlis init` wrote, by its exact
//! text, and names every line near it that it left because a person wrote it.
