//! The bounded child that reads a branch with gitoxide (FM-4, D-88h).
//!
//! **Why a child.** The app reads a branch's changes by itself after every write an agent
//! makes, in a folder that agent controls. Read inside the app, a branch built to hurt the read
//! hurt the app: an ignore file linked to an endless device grew it by gigabytes in under a
//! second, a FIFO named as an ignore file hung the read for ever, and gitoxide's status kept
//! memory per untracked file on every read. So the read runs in a short-lived child of
//! charter's own binary, which the app can kill:
//! - **charter's own binary, never git, never a shell**: the app's executable, started again
//!   with [`READ_ARG`], answers one question and exits ([`serve_if_asked`]). It is the same code
//!   at the same version, with nothing to install or find on `PATH`;
//! - **a cleared environment**: only `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, which the read uses to find
//!   the operator's own git config (their global ignore file among it), and nothing of `GIT_*`;
//! - **a deadline**: the child stops itself past [`git::READ`](crate::worktree::git::READ), and
//!   the app kills it [`GRACE`] after that, so a child whose app quit or crashed during a hung
//!   read still ends;
//! - **a memory cap**: the child watches its own resident memory and stops itself past
//!   [`MEMORY`] — nothing else kills it for that (on every platform, Windows included:
//!   `RLIMIT_AS` cannot be set below what a macOS process has already mapped, so a limit the
//!   kernel enforces is not available there);
//! - **a capped answer**: at most [`OUTPUT`] bytes are read back, as JSON;
//! - **a few at once, app-wide**: at most [`AT_ONCE`] readers run at the same time, across every
//!   window and branch. An ask past that waits for one to finish, within its own deadline, so
//!   many branches built to hang their reads cost a fixed number of children, not one each.
//!   Asks are let in the order they came, and one left with too little of its deadline after
//!   the wait is answered as busy rather than started (#1605);
//! - **a pause for a branch that keeps hanging**: one whose reads ran into their deadline or
//!   memory cap twice in a row is not read again for a pause that doubles with each further
//!   strike, so re-reading it cannot keep the places full ([`Strikes`], #1605).
//!
//! A read that is killed or capped fails: the window says so, and the watch counts the batch as
//! one that matters.
