//! The asks that wait on a human, and the one rule for answering them (HP-5): **one answer per
//! ask, and the first wins.**
//!
//! Several clients can show the same ask at once: the window, `charter inbox`, later a paired
//! device. Whichever answers first applies; every other answer, from another client or the same
//! one twice, is refused with "answered elsewhere". An answer that comes too late, to an ask the
//! source has sent again, or to one the chat withdrew is refused too, each with a sentence
//! saying why, so a client can tell its operator instead of failing quietly.
//!
//! **A timeout never answers.** An ask on a hook carries a deadline below the hook's timeout
//! ([`super::model::Deadline::below_hook_timeout`]). Once it passes, charter stops holding the ask and the
//! source's own prompt decides, in the pane; charter neither allows nor denies on the
//! operator's behalf. An ACP ask has no deadline and waits (ADR 0080 §5, V28d).
//!
//! **"Allow always" is never offered** (V28c, #1059). An allow that a source keeps past the
//! session can be written into the worktree's harness settings, where it outlives the chat and
//! a later chat reads it as standing permission (`claude-agent-acp` does, #783). The hook path
//! drops it where the ask is read (`super::hooked`); the registry drops it from every ask it
//! raises, whatever the source, so no client is offered it, and refuses it, saying why, from a
//! client that sends its id anyway. A lasting reject, and an allow for the session, stay.
//!
//! **Only a human answers** (V16, V75, ADR 0080 §5.3). An [`Answerer`] is made only from a
//! connection the host admitted as a human scope, the window or `charter inbox`; a chat never
//! is one. An ask that elicits a secret is answered from the window alone.
//!
//! The registry is in memory and holds no store: it lives in the host that holds the chats'
//! hooks and protocols, and an ask dies with its run (ADR 0080 §6). Time is passed in, so a
//! deadline is decided by the caller's clock and tested without sleeping.
