    ///
    /// * `-c hooks.<Event>=[…]` arms a hook for ONE session. Codex lists its source as
    ///   "Session flags", and it runs BESIDE the operator's own `[[hooks.<Event>]]` for
    ///   the same event rather than replacing it — both fired. Nothing is written.
    /// * `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop` and `SessionEnd` each fire with
    ///   `session_id` in the payload. `SessionStart` names a `source` (`startup`, and
    ///   `resume` with the SAME id on `codex resume <id>`); `SessionEnd` names a
    ///   `reason` (`other`, on `/quit`). `Stop` is "right before Codex ends its turn",
    ///   which is the falling edge `Stop` means for Claude Code.
    /// * There is no `Notification`. Codex tells a hook it is asking for approval only
    ///   through `PermissionRequest` — which fired exactly when the prompt appeared,
    ///   and not for a command that needed none. That hook DECIDES a permission, so the
    ///   app arms it as Claude Code's is (#1691, [`permission_flag`]): it decides only
    ///   what the person chose in the window, and otherwise nothing, and Codex asks.
    /// * **And there is no second way round it** (charter-app#52, read out of the same
    ///   0.147.0 binary the measurements above were taken on). The binary carries
    ///   eleven hook events and no more — `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`,
    ///   `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`,
    ///   `UserPromptSubmit`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop` — and the only
    ///   one that fires when the prompt appears is the one that decides it. The
    ///   `notify` program is not a second channel either: in 0.147.0 it is
    ///   `legacy_notify`, a shim over `Stop` whose one payload type is
    ///   `agent-turn-complete`, which is the falling edge `Stop` already gives. What
    ///   is left is `PreToolUse` without a matching `PostToolUse` for long enough —
    ///   which is a guess at timing over a harness's behaviour, and ADR 0018 admits
    ///   no state that did not come from a hook saying so.
    /// * `SessionStart` fires inside the FIRST TURN, not at launch (X1): an idle TUI
    ///   reported nothing at all until a prompt was typed.
    /// * A hook is inert until Codex trusts it. For these, the TUI itself asks at
    ///   startup — "Hooks need review … Trust all and continue / Continue without
    ///   trusting (hooks won't run)" — and Codex writes the answer into its own
    ///   `[hooks.state]`, keyed by event, position and a hash of the hook. The same
    ///   binary path arms the same hooks, so the operator is asked once and not once a
    ///   chat. Untrusted, they do not run and nothing says so (`codex exec`).
    ///
    /// Codex has no plugin here: the guard used to reach a Codex chat through the
    /// Python charter's Codex plugin, and now rides on the same `-c` flags as the state
    /// hooks, from the same registry ([`crate::plugin::CODEX`] out of [`crate::hookreg`]).
