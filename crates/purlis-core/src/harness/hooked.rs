//! A level-2 ask: a harness's permission hook, held open on the hook channel until the operator
//! answers it from the window, and answered back on that same hook (HP-6, research track 04
//! §5.2).
//!
//! Claude Code runs `charter hook permissionrequest` when it would ask for a permission. The
//! hook hands its payload to the host on the hook channel and waits; the host raises it in the
//! shared [`Asks`] and holds the connection. The operator's answer goes back on that connection
//! as the option they chose, and the hook prints the harness's own decision for it
//! ([`decision`]). Nothing is typed into the chat's terminal, so the pane need not have focus.
//!
//! **What decides, when nobody answers.** The ask carries a deadline below the hook's timeout
//! ([`HOOK_TIMEOUT`], [`super::model::Deadline::below_hook_timeout`]). Past it, and whenever the
//! hook goes away first, the hook prints nothing and the harness's own prompt decides in the
//! pane. charter never allows or denies on its own.
//!
//! **Only a human answers** ([`Answerer`], V16, V75). On the hook channel a chat can raise an
//! ask and never answer one: the host reads no answer there, and the hook believes a reply
//! only from a listener that is its own ancestor ([`crate::hookwire::permission`]).
//!
//! **An answer is bound to its chat.** The registry is keyed by ask and chat together
//! ([`Asks::answer`]), so an answer naming another chat, or one replayed after the first, is
//! refused and never reaches a hook.
