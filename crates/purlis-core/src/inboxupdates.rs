//! **The Inbox's updates** (#1693, spec #1688, I-6, I-8, I-10): what happened that the person
//! may want to know and need not answer — a task that finished or failed, a doctor finding, a
//! chat that resumed, a sandbox change, a dispatch refused while nobody was there, a Smart close
//! that stopped, a report with nowhere to go, a commit refused — kept **per machine for a day**
//! in purlis's data home and never in a project, so it survives a relaunch, is never committed
//! and is never sent.
//!
//! An update is not an ask: nothing waits on it. The window derives each one from the source
//! that already says it (the finished rows, the doctor's report, the chats a launch put back,
//! the sandbox's blocks, the away list, a Smart close's steps) and notes it here by a key of its
//! own, so the same update noted again is one update. What the person did with it is kept with
//! it: **read** (Mark all read) and **dismissed** (Dismiss, Dismiss all). A dismissed update is
//! kept, unseen, until its day is over, so its source saying it again does not bring it back.
//!
//! # Where and how
//!
//! `<data>/inbox/<project key>.json` (the key is the digest the sandbox's cache homes and the
//! network record are named by), one JSON array, rewritten whole under a lock on its folder,
//! 0600. A write lets go of what is older than [`KEPT_FOR_SECS`] and past [`AT_MOST_KEPT`].
//! A file this build cannot read, or one larger than [`MOST_BYTES`], reads as no updates and is
//! written over: an update is information, and losing a day of it loses nothing that waits.
//!
//! **What a chat named is data.** A chain names chats, and an update says what its source said
//! of them; each is held to a bound here ([`MOST_SAID`], [`MOST_NAME`], [`MOST_CHAIN`],
//! [`MOST_KEY`]), and the window draws it as text.
