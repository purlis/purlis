//! The `charter` command line, in Rust.
//!
//! Only the plane commands M1.1 covers are here, and only as far as the PLANE goes. The
//! recorded scenarios (`tests/fixtures/recorded/`, ADR 0046) prove that: each runs this binary
//! against a copy of a fixture plane and compares the tree it leaves with what the Python
//! charter left.
//!
//! **`-w` and `--persona` are optional, and M2.9 is what made them so.** Every rung of both
//! resolution ladders lives in [`purlis_core::active`]; this file only decides which flag
//! feeds each one. Until then `charter recall` with no flags — how a harness calls it at
//! session start — refused with exit **2**, and every `-w` was a clap usage error.
//!
//! `root` and the hidden `--now` have no Python counterpart at all: `--now` is the test seam
//! charter itself has as `memstore.write(stamp=…)`.

///
/// #89 says this is "the `charter hook` trigger Python has". It is not: `charter/hooks.py`
/// never calls `glstate.maybe_spawn`, and `sessionstart()` does not go near it. Python's one
/// trigger is `charter/statusline.py:_render`, which calls `glstate.read_for` and then
/// `glstate.maybe_spawn` on the footer's own render path — every turn that draws the footer
/// kicks a refresh. So this is not a port of a call site. It is the POLICY ported (that is
/// `glstate.rs`, #69) put on a path Python does not use for it, and the reason is that the
/// path Python does use is not available here:
///
/// - **Inside the app** `purlis statusline` draws nothing and returns early (ADR 0019), and
///   the app has its own trigger already — `panels::repo_states`, focusing a workspace.
/// - **Outside it**, `statusLine` is armed only for chats the app starts and only where the
///   operator fills that line with nothing (`harness::claude_code_status_line`,
///   `footerclaim`). A plane with no app open has no `purlis statusline` running at all —
///   purlis #895 deleted the one that used to be wired — while the plugin's hooks DO run.
///
/// Which leaves this: the hook is the only thing purlis runs on a plane nobody has an app
/// open on, so it is the only place the trigger can go.
///
/// # Why only `SessionStart`, and only with no app behind it
///
/// **Once a session, not once a turn.** The brakes make a repeat trigger cheap — past the
/// cooldown is two file reads — but "cheap" multiplied by every prompt and every turn end is
/// the shape #69's brakes exist to prevent, on a path with a budget. `SessionStart` is the one
/// event that fires once, and with `REFRESH_TTL` at 300 s a per-turn trigger buys no freshness
/// a per-session one does not.
///
/// **And only where the app is not.** `$CHARTER_HOOK_SOCKET` in the environment means this
/// chat was started by the app, which already decides when a refresh runs. Two deciders on one
/// plane is not unsafe — the lock is what makes that safe — but it is two policies, and the
/// issue is about the plane that has none.
///
/// # What it costs
///
/// Everything here is filesystem-only: resolving the plane, reading the workspace ladder,
/// listing the workspace's clones and their worktree directories (`glrefresh::trees` is
/// `read_dir` and path arithmetic — no git spawn), then `glstate::decide`'s two file reads.
/// The one expensive act, the fork, happens at most once per `SPAWN_COOLDOWN` and is a spawn
/// and never a wait. Measured on this machine over 300 runs each, `purlis hook sessionstart`
/// against a plane whose cache is fresh: **3.68 ms before, 3.66 ms after**, against a
/// `purlis --version` floor of 3.63 ms — the added work does not clear the noise of starting
/// the process at all.
///
/// # Best-effort, and silent about it
///
/// Nothing here is worth a word on a reporting hook: no plane, no readable workspace, no
/// `current_exe`, a fork that failed — each simply means no refresh, and the column already
/// says "nothing has fetched this checkout" rather than reading as green (#69). Python's own
