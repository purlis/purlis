# purlis

A desktop app for running many agent chats across your projects, and always knowing which of
them needs you. This file is the glossary: the words, not how they are built.

## Language

### The five concepts

purlis has five concepts: **Project**, **Workspace**, **Chat**, **Persona** and **Memory**.
Every other word here is a part, a view or a setting of one of them, and the first hour's
screens say only those five plus **Save** and **branch** (ADR 0072).

**Project**:
One of the five concepts: the git repo that holds a team's workspaces, personas, memory and
settings, and the tab the app shows it in. The app can hold several. Vaults, save modes,
extensions and everything that holds for the whole machine are its settings. A code repo is
never a project, on any forge: it is a **repo** (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: instance, plane (in UI text), project (for a GitLab repo)

**Project template**:
A part of **Project**: a stack's starting layout, chosen in the first run — two personas, a
starter `workspace.md` context, a review checklist (`REVIEW.md` in the reviewer persona's refs)
and the commands every harness asks about first. purlis ships one each for Rust, TypeScript,
Python, Go, monorepos and docs-only repos, as data with a version, and lays one out only where
nothing is there yet (FR-17).
_Avoid_: plane template, scaffold, starter kit

**Workspace**:
One of the five concepts: a named piece of work inside a plane, with its own charter
(`workspace.md`), memory, todos and repos.
_Avoid_: task, context

**Chat**:
One of the five concepts: one conversation with an agent, in a tab, in one workspace or at the
plane root. It is where work happens and what needs you. It has a number the window shows
(`steward 3`) and an id that never changes, has one or more **runs**, and shows its
**branches**, one per repo it works in (ADR 0066, ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: session (that is the process), thread, agent, conversation (that is the harness's)

**Persona**:
One of the five concepts: a role a chat runs as for its whole life, with its own charter
(`persona.md`), memory and vault. A chat's persona is fixed when the chat starts and never
changes, and work for another persona goes to a chat of its own, by **dispatch**. Its curation
actions and its logs are parts of it (ADR 0072 as amended, ADR 0090).
_Avoid_: agent, sub-agent (that is a harness's helper inside a chat, which carries the chat's
persona and is never one itself), bot, role (as the name)

**Memory**:
One of the five concepts: what purlis keeps so the next chat starts knowing what earlier ones
learned. Each memory has an **owner**: a workspace, a persona, everyone (shared memory, in
`personas/_shared/memory/`) or **me**, one person's own, kept in a personal overlay plane on
their own private remote. It also has an **audience**: this machine, me on all my machines, or
the team. Approval follows the audience: memory the team will read waits for approval, so
nothing reaches a teammate's briefing unreviewed. Session records are memory too. `purlis recall`
searches it as one, and a chat's briefing is drawn from it (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: knowledge, rules, notes (for the whole of it), context

### The plane and what lives in it

**Plane**:
The git repo a project's purlis lives in: its settings, personas, memory, todos and
workspaces. It is the project's database, and a change counts once it reaches the plane's
remote. **The word is being retired**, everywhere: the new term is **Project**, in the window,
`purlis --help`, the docs, the code and the format. Until the rename lands, the code and the
format still say plane, and purlis reads the old names for a compat window (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: control plane, config repo, purlis repo

**purlis-plane**:
The purlis project's own plane: the one purlis is developed from, at `purlis/purlis-plane`,
private since it moved there (V92). It is not the product. The product, the app and its core, is
**purlis**.
_Avoid_: purlis (for the plane), the purlis repo

**charter** (the old name):
What purlis was called until 2026-10-05 (ADR 0091). purlis still reads its old names until 1.0
(the compatibility window), the `charter` command runs purlis until then, and names the code
still spells `charter` keep that spelling. In new prose it is only ever the old name, or a role's
charter: the English word for what a persona or workspace is for.
_Avoid_: charter (for the product)

**Work item**:
One piece of work a tracker holds: a forge issue, epic or sub-issue, or a todo (the plane's own
tracker). A chat links to at most one; a work item may have many chats. It is part of a
Workspace, shown in its Work section, and never a sixth concept (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: task, ticket (in UI text), card (that is how a board draws one)

**Tracker key**:
A work item's identity: the tracker's name and the item's own reference where it lives, such as
`github:github.com/owner/repo#12` or `todo:<workspace>/<todo>`. Two devices name the same item
the same way. When an item moves, its old key is kept and points to the new one. It belongs to
**Workspace**, with the work item it names (ADR 0088).
_Avoid_: issue id, forge id (that is the forge's own identifier, which travels beside the key)

**Work link**:
A workspace's or a chat's record that it works on a work item. A chat has at most one; a
workspace may have many. The project keeps them, so they reach every device. It belongs to
**Workspace** (ADR 0088).
_Avoid_: link (unqualified: that is the runner link), relation

**Relation** (between work items):
How one work item stands to another: a pull or merge request that closes it, blocked-by, or
parent and child. It belongs to **Workspace**, with the work items it joins (ADR 0088).
_Avoid_: link (unqualified), dependency (that is one kind of relation)

**Board** (of work items):
A view of a workspace's (or project's) work items, one card per item. It is derived each time
from the work links and the trackers, and never stored, so a todo promoted to an issue is one
card. It belongs to **Workspace**, in its Work section (FI5).
_Avoid_: project (GitHub's word for its boards), kanban

**Plane root**:
The plane's own directory, as a place a chat works — and anywhere else in the plane that is no
workspace's, such as `docs/`: the workspace strip's first tab, drawn as an icon, always there. A chat started there is in no workspace on purpose — it looks after the
plane and names a workspace with `-w` when it acts on one. It is not a workspace: it has no
purlis, memory or todos. In code it is still `OUTSIDE`, the strip every chat working in no
workspace is filed on.
_Avoid_: master, home, outside every workspace (in UI text), the default workspace

**Repo** (of a workspace):
A clone of a code repository that a workspace holds. It has its own remote and its own rules,
and it is never part of the plane's commits.
_Avoid_: clone (as a noun in UI text), guest checkout, project

**Piece**:
A git worktree of a workspace's repo, at `workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/<repo>/<piece>`, where
one chat works on its own branch. Git says which pieces exist. The piece log says what git
cannot: that purlis cut it (`claimed`), and whether its worker declared it `done` or
`abandoned`. A piece that declared nothing is **silent**, reported as an age and never as a
failure.
On screen a piece is shown as its **branch**, and its directory as the branch's **folder**:
the explorer's rows, the palette's titles, the Changes view and the refusals the window shows say
"branch" or "folder", never "worktree" (#989). A menu row names a branch by its own name, and
a folder git has on no branch as a folder. "Piece" and "worktree" stay in the plane format, the
code, the `[plane] worktrees` setting and `purlis worktree` (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: task, slot, branch (for the directory), worktree (on screen)

**Branch** (of a chat):
What the window shows for a piece: one row per repo a chat works in, reading *`<branch>` in
`<repo>`*. A chat working in a repo's shared clone shows the branch the clone has checked out,
marked *shared*. **New branch** cuts a piece; **Remove folder** removes the worktree and keeps
the branch (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: the chat's branch (singular: a chat may work in several repos), piece, worktree (in UI text)

**Writing chat**:
A chat that starts in a repo's shared clone (`workspaces/<ws>/<repo>`), which is what *New tab
in <repo>* and *Start new chats in <repo>* point at. By default it starts on a new branch of its
own instead: a piece named after the chat, or `chat-<n>`, cut before it starts and taken back if
the start is refused. The picker's *start on a new branch* box, ticked by default, is the
opt-out. A chat started in the workspace's own directory, at the project root or in an existing
piece is not a writing chat and is cut nothing (GL-1).
_Avoid_: guessing from what a chat does (purlis never reads a harness's output to decide)

**Change** (cross-repo):
One piece of work across several of a workspace's repos, recorded as intent only in
`workspaces/<ws>/changes/<slug>.json`: why, which repos, which branch in each, and which must
land first. Whether each part is pushed, checked or landed is read from git and the forge, and
never stored (ADR 0060).
_Avoid_: change (for one pull request), changeset, epic

**Member**:
One repo's part of a change: the repo, its branch for this change, and the members it `needs`
landed first.
_Avoid_: part, sub-change

**Request**:
A member's pull request, or merge request on GitLab.
_Avoid_: change (for a PR), MR/PR in UI text

**Landed**:
A member whose request the forge reports merged, that purlis landed, and whose merge commit, as
purlis's landing log recorded it, is still on the default branch. A merge purlis queued, or
whose read-back failed, is landed once a later `purlis change land` finds it merged at its
**pending landing**'s head and logs it.
_Avoid_: merged (a browser merge is merged but not logged), done

**Pending landing**:
purlis's evidence that it started landing a member: the request, the head its checks passed on
and how (direct or queue), written before the forge is asked. Only a merge at that head is ever
logged as purlis's; a refused one is no evidence.
_Avoid_: queued (a pending landing is also written for a direct merge), in flight

**Inventory**:
The plane's list of repos it can clone (`inventory/repos.json`), committed and shared. It only
grows: `discover` and the repo picker add to it, and a repo leaves it only through an exclude.
_Avoid_: repo list (for what the picker shows), catalogue

**Reachable repos**:
The repos your own forge login can reach under the plane's owners, as the repo picker shows
them. Asked each time the picker opens and never saved, because each engineer reaches different
ones.
_Avoid_: discovered repos, the inventory

**Forge account**:
One sign-in to one forge host: a kind, a host and a login, held in the keyring or reached
through `gh`'s or `glab`'s own login. Each repo is bound to one (ADR 0070). It is the human's,
signed in from the window through a forge registration, a PAT or an imported CLI login, and it
never reaches a chat. It holds for the whole machine, so it is a setting of the **Project**
(ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0077).
_Avoid_: forge login (for purlis's own sign-in), connection, integration

**Forge registration**:
What a forge host knows purlis by when a person signs in: a GitHub App on GitHub, an OAuth
application on GitLab, identified by a public client id. purlis's own exist on github.com and
gitlab.com; a GHES or a self-managed GitLab needs one made on that host. It mints nothing for an
agent. A setting of the **Project**, like the forge account that uses it (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0077).
_Avoid_: OAuth app (unqualified), integration, client

**Forge capability**:
One thing a forge may or may not do for one repo, such as a merge queue, judged per forge, host
and tier, with the fallback purlis uses where it is unavailable (ADR 0070).
_Avoid_: capability (unqualified, which is an extension's), feature flag

**LIVE / LOCAL**:
Whether a workspace's charter, memory and todos are published with the plane (LIVE) or stay on
this machine (LOCAL, the default).
_Avoid_: shared/private, public

**Tier** (of a store):
Where a file purlis keeps lives, and so what a backup, a second machine and a deletion do to
it. **Plane** is committed. **Clone state** is per clone and never committed: `.charter/`,
`charter.local.toml` and a LOCAL workspace's files. **Machine** is outside every plane, and each
store there is syncable or device-bound. **Keyring** is the operating system's credential store.
A derived store is also marked rebuildable (ADR 0069).
_Avoid_: app data (for the Machine tier as a whole), cache (for clone state), local state

**Clone-key**:
A project clone's identity on a machine: the first 16 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the
clone's canonical root path. It keys the reopen record's `clone` (V43), the search index will
be keyed on it (ADR 0079), and a save branch's default name takes its first six. A clone's own
word for itself, never committed, and different in every copy at another path. A copy at the
same path on another machine has the same key, and the device id is what tells it apart.
_Avoid_: clone id, plane hash, install id

**Copy** (of a project):
A second clone made from a project's directory, `.charter/` and all: `cp -R`, rsync, a backup
restored beside the original, or the same path on another machine. Its first launch finds that
another clone still holds its chats, or that another device wrote its record, and gives every
chat a new id (V43). A `git clone` is not a copy in this sense: it carries no `.charter/`.
_Avoid_: fork (that is a workspace's), duplicate

**Move** (of a project):
The same clone at a new path on the same machine. Its first launch finds no other clone holding
its chats, so the chats keep their ids and the record names the new clone-key (V43).
_Avoid_: rename (that is a workspace's), relocation

### Runs and devices

**Run**:
One stretch of a chat's conversation with a harness, over which its persona, harness, profile,
model source, device, sandbox and harness level stay the same. A chat has one or more runs, one
after another. A new one begins when the chat starts, on `/clear`, when the app reopens it, when
it wakes, when it starts again without its conversation, or when any of those attributes
changes. Compaction keeps the run. A **child run** is a sub-agent or teammate the harness
spawns, with the run it came from as its parent: a **helper**, as the app shows it. The run is
who an action is attributed to (W8's "agent run"), and budgets add up over a chat's runs (ADRs
0066, 0073).
_Avoid_: session (that is the process), conversation (that is the harness's), turn

**Run state**:
Where a run is. While it lives: `queued`, `starting`, `working`, `input-required`, `paused` or
`hibernated`. Then, once and for good: `completed`, `failed` or `stopped`. **Stopped** is an end
someone chose (the operator, a policy, the kill switch, the host); **failed** is one nobody chose.
A chat's state is its current run's (ADR 0076).
_Avoid_: status, session state (the old five), done (for completed), idle (for a state)

**Hot chat**:
A chat whose current run has a process: `starting`, `working`, `input-required` or `paused`.
An **open** chat is any chat whose current run is live, hot or not; a hibernated one is open and
not hot. purlis's scale is counted in these per device: a target of 200 open, and a hot target
per **RAM class** (ADR 0082).
_Avoid_: active chat, live chat (live is a run state's), running chat (in UI text)

**RAM class**:
A device's physical memory, as the largest of 8, 16, 32 and 64 GB it reaches, which sets how
many hot chats the device targets; a device under 8 GB targets one. A property of the device, so
it belongs to Project. A budget, never a cap: purlis warns past it and refuses nothing (ADR 0082).
_Avoid_: tier (that is a store's), machine size, profile

**Performance budget**:
One measured limit on what purlis's chats cost the device: a count, a size, a time or a share of
a core, stated at the device's hot target, and named with the job that measures it. It is
checked in CI either exactly or against what `main` last recorded, or on the operator's machine
at each release. It is a target, never a promise, and never a cap on the operator. The spec's
speed and memory limits are performance budgets too; its open and hot chat counts are targets. It belongs to **Chat** (ADR 0086).
_Avoid_: budget (unqualified: that is a chat's spend budget), limit (for a row CI checks only
against earlier runs), SLA

**Remote chat**:
A vendor-cloud session purlis lists read-only, with its state, pull request and cost: a chat of
kind **observed**, which purlis never pauses, stops or counts toward a budget. Every chat
purlis starts is **governed** (W8, ADR 0076).
_Avoid_: cloud chat, external agent, remote runner (that is a **Runner**)

**Device**:
A machine purlis runs on: a desktop, a runner, or later a viewer. Each has a random id kept in
its machine store, which is how records, events and the audit say where something happened. Its
hostname is a label, never a key. The operator on a device is its **local principal**
(`local:<device>/<os-user>`), and purlis never sends it anywhere without an account (ADR 0066).
_Avoid_: host (that is `purlisd`, the process), machine (in UI text), node

**Harness declaration**:
Data that says how to start one harness, how to name and resume its sessions, which levels it
offers and what it can do. The ones for Claude Code, Codex and opencode ship with purlis; a
project may declare more, which each machine approves before they run, and never replaces a
built-in's (ADR 0073).
_Avoid_: harness definition, harness config (that is the harness's own), profile (that is which
program runs on this machine)

**Harness level**:
How much purlis learns from a chat's harness, set when a run starts and fixed for it: **1**,
the terminal alone; **2**, the terminal with the harness's own hooks reporting to purlis; **3**,
a structured protocol, ACP or the harness's own. A fall back to a lower level starts a new run.
Never shown on a first-hour surface (ADR 0073).
_Avoid_: tier (that is a store's), mode, integration level

**Harness capability**:
One thing a harness does or does not do for a chat, such as report that it is waiting: yes, no
with the fallback purlis uses, or unknown, which reads as no. The capability card shows the
*no*s in plain words (ADR 0073).
_Avoid_: capability (unqualified, which is an extension's), feature, support

**Model choice**:
The model a chat runs on: the model, its provider, and the **model source** it is reached
through. Set on the chat, or given as a default by its persona, its workspace or the project, and
fixed for a run. It is always shown with the account it is billed to (ADR 0087).
_Avoid_: model config, model settings

**Model source**:
How a chat reaches its model: the harness's own **login**, a **key** the user keeps in a vault,
or a **local** model. None of them passes through purlis's servers. purlis never reads, stores
or relays a harness's login (ADR 0087).
_Avoid_: provider (that is who serves the model), backend, BYO (for the whole of it)

**Session host** (`purlisd`):
The process that owns every chat's terminal on a device, one per OS user per device: the
`purlis` binary run as `purlis serve`. The app is its client (ADR 0068).
_Avoid_: daemon, server (in UI text), backend

**Session protocol**:
The small, public, versioned set of commands and events a session host answers on its control
lane: list, attach and detach, write, resize, answer, stop, start, and subscribe from a cursor.
It carries the compatibility promise, so a client and a host one version apart always talk.
It names a project by its stable id (`[project] id` in `charter.toml`), never by a path, and
every word it says is snake_case (ADR 0068 §4 and *Amended by FD-26*).
_Avoid_: API (unqualified), IPC (that is the window's Tauri calls)

**UI RPC**:
The app's own commands (`ipc_commands.rs`), called by the window on the same control lane as
the session protocol. Private to one build of the app, served only to `local-ui`, and promising
nothing across versions (ADR 0068 §4, FD-26).
_Avoid_: session protocol (for any of it), public API

**Runner**:
A device, other than the one the window is on, whose own session host runs a workspace's chats,
serves a version of one of its repos, or runs browsers, as its **label** says. A long-lived runner
is a machine the operator adds; a short-lived one is made by a **runner provider** for a human or
a chat, for minutes or hours. Either way the desktop's session host reaches it through a
**connector** and talks to it over a **link**, and its shell, logs, ports and browser views come
only that way. It keeps its own device id, event log, audit chain and kill switch, and it needs
no server purlis runs. A short-lived runner is owned by the chat that started it, or by its
workspace when a human started it or **pinned** it there. A runner is a device, so it belongs to
**Project**; which runner a workspace's chats run on is a **Workspace** setting, and the
**Runners** view tab shows a workspace's runners (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0078, ADR 0089).
_Avoid_: remote (unqualified), agent host, worker, server (in UI text), sandbox, environment, box,
belongs to (for the lifecycle sense: say "is owned by")

**Connector**:
The command whose stdin and stdout reach a runner's session host: `ssh <alias>`,
`gh codespace ssh`, `coder ssh`, `docker exec -i`, `kubectl exec -i`, and later the relay. Held
as an argument vector on the machine that uses it, never committed in a project. It gives
reachability, never identity. It belongs to **Project**, with the device it reaches (ADR 0072
§2, ADR 0078).
_Avoid_: transport (that is FD-4's framing), tunnel, provider (that is the **runner provider**,
which creates the machine)

**Link**:
The encrypted, mutually authenticated stream between the desktop's session host and a runner's,
carried by a connector. Each end proves itself with its device's link key, pinned when the runner
was added, in a Noise `XX` handshake. The desktop always opens it. It belongs to **Project**,
with the two devices it joins (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0078).
_Avoid_: connection (unqualified), session (that is the process), pairing (that is how the keys
were pinned)

**Label** (of a runner):
What a runner is for: exactly one of `harness` (runs chats), `app` (serves one version of a
workspace repo) or `browser` (runs browsers only purlis drives). purlis enforces it at both
ends of the link: only a `harness` runner starts chats, and a `browser` runner never receives a
vault value. Tags, any words the operator picks, sit beside it and are enforced by nothing. A
part of **Runner**, so it belongs to **Project** (ADR 0089).
_Avoid_: role (unqualified), type, capability (that is an extension's), tag (for the role label)

**Runner provider**:
What makes and destroys short-lived runners and hands back a connector to each: purlis's own
core provider, which drives Docker or Podman on this machine, or an extension on the provider
seam for anything else. It declares which labels it may make; whether its machines are the
user's own is the operator's setting for it, never its own claim, and starts as not owned. A
part of **Project**, beside the extensions it is one of (ADR 0078 §6, ADR 0089).
_Avoid_: provider (unqualified: a vault's provider is where a vault keeps its values, ADR 0047,
and a model's is who serves the model, ADR 0087), backend (in UI text), executor, cloud,
connector (that only reaches a runner)

**Grant** (to a runner):
A human's approval, once per workspace on this machine, of one vault entry an app runner's spec
declares it needs. purlis injects the value when that runner starts and only when it builds a
ref a human chose, never an agent's own unreviewed branch, and never into its image or logs. An
agent may start a runner with the grants it has and never adds one; a `browser` runner, and a
runner of a provider not marked as owned, never gets one. A setting of **Workspace** (ADR 0089).
_Avoid_: permission, secret (for the approval), capability (that is an extension's)

**Editor protocol**:
The part of the session host's public protocol an editor integration speaks: find which chat or
workspace a file belongs to, ask the window to show one, type a selection into a chat's prompt
without sending it, and list a chat's changed files. Nothing in it starts, sends to or answers a
chat. It is a part of the session host, so it belongs to **Project** (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0081).
_Avoid_: editor API, editor extension API (that is a non-goal: code running inside purlis's editor)

**Audit**:
The record of who did what, for whom, to what, and whether it was allowed, kept per device by
the session host as **audit entries** in purlis's data home, never in a project. Once AU-3
lands, the entries are a device-signed hash chain. It is never sampled, and it is a separate
system from telemetry (ADR 0075).
_Avoid_: log (unqualified), history, `purlis secret audit` (that is a vault health report)

**Audit entry**:
One line of the audit, written from one event: an action, its actor and whose behalf it acted
on (both as keyed pseudonyms), what it acted on, its outcome, and typed metadata. Never a prompt,
output, file contents, raw arguments or a secret value. An agent's entry says what purlis could
see of its run: its **coverage** (ADR 0075).
_Avoid_: audit event (the event is what the entry is written from), log line

**Coverage** (of an audit entry):
What purlis could see of the run an agent's audit entry is about, set by its harness level:
the process only (level 1), the tool calls its hooks report (level 2), or every tool call its
protocol reports (level 3). A level-2 run whose hooks never reported is **unarmed**, and a
vendor-cloud chat purlis only lists is **observed**. Shown beside the entry, so silence is never
read as "did nothing" (ADR 0073, ADR 0075).
_Avoid_: level (that is the run's), completeness

**Telemetry**:
What purlis measures about how chats and purlis itself perform: time, resources, tokens and
cost. It is one OpenTelemetry pipeline per device: the session host receives what the harnesses
and purlis report, keeps it on the device for a month, and sends it only to the user's own
**export destinations**. The opt-in product telemetry and crash reports are telemetry too, each
with its own consent. It may be sampled, never names a person, and never reads the audit (ADR
0075, ADR 0083).
_Avoid_: audit, analytics, metrics (for the whole of it), log (that is the diagnostic log)

**Content gate**:
A switch that lets telemetry keep what was said in a chat: `prompts`, or tool arguments and
results (`tools`). Both are off by default. Only the human opens one, for a project, on this
machine; a project's settings or an org's policy can only close it (ADR 0083).
_Avoid_: redaction (that is removing secrets from text), privacy mode

**Export destination**:
A backend the user added, such as Langfuse, Grafana or Datadog, that the device's telemetry is
sent to over OTLP. A machine setting, never a project's, and later also an org's (ADR 0083).
_Avoid_: exporter (that is the harness's own sender), sink (that is the audit's)

**Search index**:
A derived SQLite full-text index that search, `recall` and the briefing read, kept so they need
not scan every file. Each project clone has one over its memory, session records and todos, in
`.charter/`; each machine has one over the transcript archive, in purlis's data home. The
session host is its only writer, and a chat searches only its own clone's. It is never the
truth: deleting it costs a rebuild. It holds the words of what it indexes, with their positions
and after redaction, but not the text as written. A deleted item stops answering at once and
leaves the file at the next merge and checkpoint; an unlinked old copy is not overwritten. It
never answers a reader with anything the files would not (ADR 0079).
_Avoid_: index (unqualified: `memory/index.md` and `sessions/index.md` are lists for people),
cache, database

### Chats working together

Every agent another agent starts is a chat, so each word here is a part of **Chat** (ADR 0090).

**Dispatch**:
One chat starting another, with a brief. Its mode is a **task** or a **handoff**. The chat it
starts is a **persona chat**, with its own persona, sandbox, vaults and asks. Nothing the
**asking chat** was allowed travels with the brief, and the brief is a request from a chat, never
the person's word. The person can dispatch too.
_Avoid_: spawn, delegate, delegation, sub-agent (that is the harness's child run)

**Task** (of a dispatch):
A dispatch that expects a **report**, and the chat it starts: work done for the asking chat. It
is listed under the asking chat, never hidden, and is shown inside its session's tab: the tab
of the nearest chat above it that has one. Pressing the task switches that tab to it and adds
no tab; the pane's top line then says the path (`steward 4 › talk · working`). It has a pane
of its own only when the person asks: **a tab of its own**, drawn with the task mark, whose
task it is and a minimise where a session's tab has its close, or a pane **beside** its
session, inside the session's tab. The minimise **sends it back** and ends nothing; a session's
close is the only close on the strip. "Task" is the
word in every sentence the app shows for that chat. Its row says its state in a word
beside a mark with a shape of its own, the same in every list: working, needs you,
`asking <chat>`, done, failed, cancelled, or ended without a report. A chat at rest that is
not asking for the person reads idle, and one whose harness sends nothing reads
`running (no detail from <harness>)`.
The Chats list is where tasks are listed, and where every chat is: the explorer lists none
(#1673).
_Avoid_: job, todo (that is the workspace's), work item, task chat, sub-chat, persona chat (in a
shown sentence, where a task is meant)

**Ending a task** (by the person):
The two ways a person ends a task by hand, and no other: **Stop and get its report**, which
ends its turn and gives it one short turn to say what it did, and **Close now**, which ends its
program at once. Either takes a second step before anything ends. Closing a task's tab is
neither: the tab goes, and the task goes **back to the list** and keeps working. A chat's own
way to end a task it dispatched is a **cancel**.
_Avoid_: kill, terminate, close the task's tab (to mean ending it), stop chat (that is a
session's or a handoff's)

**Outcome** (of a task the asking chat is told of):
How a task ended, in purlis's own words to the chat that asked. Beside a report's own outcome
(done, blocked, failed, cancelled) there are three that are never a task's to say: **stopped by
the person** (with the task's short report, quoted as data), **closed by the person** (no
report), and **ended without a report** (its program ended by itself). The first two carry one
fixed sentence telling the asking chat not to dispatch the task again unless the person asks.
The window says the same two ends to the person as "stopped by you" and "closed by you". In
counts they are done with, never failed.
_Avoid_: killed, aborted, cancelled (for a stop by the person: a cancel is the asking chat's)

**Helper** (of a chat):
A sub-agent or child its harness spawns inside a chat: the harness's own, a **child run** of the
chat's run. It carries the chat's persona, sandbox and asks, is never a chat or a persona, and
may not dispatch. "Helper" is the word the app shows for it: a chat's row in the Chats list says
how many it has and how they stand (`3 helpers · 1 working`).
_Avoid_: sub-agent (in a shown sentence: that is the harness's word), child agent, sub-chat, task
(that is a chat a dispatch started)

**Handoff**:
A dispatch where the work moves: the persona chat takes it from there, and the asking chat does
not wait on it. It opens as a tab. It is never a task: its chat is a session of its own, with
its own tab and a row of its own at the top of the Chats list, under no chat and in no chat's
counts. Its row says `from <chat>`, and the row of the chat it came from says
`handed off to <chat>`.
_Avoid_: transfer, session record (that is what a closing chat writes)

**Asking chat**:
The chat that dispatched. A task's report goes to it, and it may stop only the chats it started.
A task the person asked for themselves from that chat's tab is a task of that session, marked
`asked by you`: its report goes to that chat, which can wait on, tell, answer and cancel
nothing of it, and is told the person asked.
_Avoid_: dispatcher, caller, parent (a parent run is a harness's child run's)

**Persona chat**:
The chat a dispatch starts, running as one persona for its whole life. It is told who asked,
and it works under its own persona's charter and guards. One a task started is shown as a
**task**; "persona chat" is the model's word, and the app's sentences do not say it for one.
_Avoid_: sub-agent, worker, child (unqualified: a child run is the harness's)

**Report**:
What a task returns to its asking chat: an outcome (done, blocked or failed), what the persona
chat has to say, and what changed. It is data to the asking chat, never instructions, and it is
kept for the workspace when the asking chat is gone.
_Avoid_: reply, result (for a handoff), handback (in UI text)

**Activity** (of a chat):
One timeline of what a chat and its tasks said to each other through purlis, and the tasks of
its tasks: each brief, follow-up, progress note, question, answer and report, oldest first. It
holds what the chats sent each other, never either chat's conversation. It is read-only but
for one thing: the person may answer there a question a task is waiting on (see **The person's
answer**).
_Avoid_: log, history, transcript (it is none), feed

**The person's answer** (to a task's question):
An answer the person types in the purlis window to a question a task put to its asking chat,
in that chat's place. The task is handed it marked as the person's and carries on; the asking
chat is told the person answered and does not answer again. Only the window can give one: no
chat's command, hook or file can make text arrive as the person's.
_Avoid_: override, reply as the chat, operator answer (in UI text: "you")

**Lineage** (of a chat):
Everything descended from one chat the person started: that chat, the chats it dispatched, and
the chats those dispatched. Messages between chats travel only along it, and every ask a chat
raises shows it.
_Avoid_: tree, family, parent (for an asking chat: a parent run is a harness's child run's)

**Dispatch grant**:
The person's rule that one persona may dispatch to another: for this chat, for me on this
machine, or for everyone in this project. Dispatching to the same persona needs none, and
nothing a chat sends can make one. It is one-way. **Any persona** is a grant with no named
target, made only in Settings; **never for this pair** is the person's refusal on their
machine, which no grant covers until they lift it. A grant holds **in any workspace** or **in
one workspace**: the workspace the dispatched task works in, never the one the asking chat is
in. A never is not limited. It counts only while both personas exist. Where a
persona was seen gone and another has its name, the grants for the name are **set aside**:
they allow nothing until the person gives them back or removes them. What a persona **wants**
(the `wants` line of its definition) is not a grant and makes none: it only puts unticked
boxes under the question, so the person can allow several pairs in one answer, each with the
workspace condition of that answer. A project grant a teammate committed **arrives**: it
allows nothing on a machine until the person there accepts it, and their yes holds only until
a commit takes the grant out.
_Avoid_: permission (that is the harness's), approval (that answers an ask)

**Refused while you were away**:
A dispatch a chat nobody was at was refused for lack of a standing grant, kept so the person
reads of it in the needs-you list afterwards and can allow the pair from then on, for work in
the workspace the refused task would have worked in. One item a pair and workspace, attached to
no chat; it is not a question and holds no dispatch. Dismissed, it stays put away while the
chat asks on.
_Avoid_: pending dispatch, queued dispatch (nothing is waiting to start)

**Headless chat**:
A chat with no tab yet. It is listed, never hidden: its asks reach needs you, Stop and the kill
switch reach it, like any chat's, and it gets a tab when the person opens it. Never a level-1
chat.
_Avoid_: background chat, unattended, hidden

**Peer message** (ADR 0090, proposed: not in the first version):
Words one chat sends another live chat, in its lineage or over a **message link**. It reaches the
receiver as quoted data at a turn boundary, and is never consent for anything.
_Avoid_: prompt (that is the operator's), message (unqualified), mail

**Mailbox** (of a chat; ADR 0090, proposed: not in the first version):
Whether a chat takes peer messages: deliver, hold or refuse, set by the operator. Held messages wait
on the chat's row.
_Avoid_: inbox (that is `purlis inbox`, a person's), queue

**Message link** (ADR 0090, proposed: not in the first version):
A person's leave for two chats, or the chats of two personas in a workspace, to send each other
peer messages outside their lineage, until it ends.
_Avoid_: link (unqualified: that is a runner's), channel, subscription

### The window

**Split window**:
An OS window a project tab was moved into, beside the main window. It holds its own projects,
and closing it moves them back to the main window with every chat still running.
_Avoid_: detached tab, pop-out, secondary window

**Strip**:
One row of tabs: projects (in the title bar), a project's workspaces, or a workspace's chats.
A strip's order never changes on its own, and it never scrolls. The operator can drag a tab
along it; dropped among the pinned tabs it is pinned, and among the others it is unpinned.
_Avoid_: tab bar, scroller

**Pin**:
One operator's mark that a project, workspace or chat matters to them. It is kept on this
machine and never in the plane. A pinned item is drawn first, and the workspace strip draws
only pinned workspaces plus the one you are in.
_Avoid_: favourite, star, bookmark, pin (for a runner: that is **Pin** (of a runner))

**Pin** (of a runner):
A human's act that gives an agent-started runner to its workspace: the runner is then owned by
the workspace instead of the chat, outlives the chat, and stops only by a human or the kill
switch. Kept in the runner's record on this machine. A part of **Runner**, so it belongs to
**Project** (ADR 0089).
_Avoid_: keep, hold, pin (unqualified, which is the strip's mark)

**Show-more**:
The button at the end of a strip that lists what the strip is not drawing, sorted by activity,
with the needs-you count of everything it hides.
_Avoid_: overflow (in UI text), more tabs

**Needs you**:
A chat that is waiting on the operator: a view, computed from its current run (an ask, a turn
that ended, a budget or policy pause) and its own items (a report it wrote that has nowhere to
go, a refused commit, a secret waiting for approval), and never a state of its own. A report
that reaches the chat that asked is that chat's to read, and is not an item. An item shows on
its chat's row and on every row above it in the Chats section. Every project's are counted on the
title bar's ✋, which opens the **Inbox**, and each is counted in red on its tab and on any
show-more hiding it. **Ignore** clears a chat's items until the next one arrives (ADR 0076).
_Avoid_: notification, alert (an alert is a **Notice**), waiting (for the state)

**Notice**:
A standing line in a project's window about something that is true now, such as a pin to a
workspace that is gone or a repo that could not be cloned. A Notice always offers a way out:
the fix itself when purlis can do it, or a link to the place where it is fixed. Dismiss
hides it until its cause changes. A reference to something gone is set aside, never removed,
and comes back when its target does. A project's Notices are listed in its **Inbox**, after the
asks; an alert purlis finds about a project or this machine is one of them (#1695). Not an
**Update**, which says what happened, and not **Needs you**, which is a chat waiting on the
operator.
_Avoid_: notification, banner, toast, message (for the thing itself)

**Away summary** ("While you were away"):
The one **Notice** each project of a window draws when the person comes back after five minutes
or more away from the window (not in use, hidden, or with no input), in place of reading what
each task did on its own: how many tasks finished done, how many failed, how many chats came to
need the person meanwhile (new to the needs-you list, or there already with something new), and
how many dispatches were refused while nobody was at their chat, each part a link to where it is
answered. It counts only what happened while the person was away. It hides nothing: every task
keeps its row and its **Activity** lines, and every question stays where it was asked. Going to
a failed task from it marks the failure looked at, as its needs-you item's Go does; dismissing
it dismisses nothing else. A setting turns it off. Away here is the person away from the window;
a chat nobody is at is another thing, whatever the window is doing.
_Avoid_: digest, recap, notification

**Ask**:
A chat's harness handing control to a human: a permission, a question, a request for values (an
ACP elicitation, which always elicits a secret), or a nudge. Every
harness's own form of it is read into one shape: what it would do, the options as the harness
offered them, who may answer, its deadline, its risk, a masked one-line summary, and whether it
elicits a secret. One answer per ask, and the first wins; every later one hears "answered
elsewhere". An agent never answers one (ADR 0080 §5). A part of **Chat**.

Everything that blocks until the person decides is an ask, whatever its source: a permission
prompt of a chat or a task, a dispatch grant, a host a chat's sandbox refused, a prompt waiting
in a harness's own terminal, a chat waiting on the person's reply. Each is derived from the
source that waits, keeps no record of its own, and is gone the moment its source stops waiting.
Each names its chain (the session first, the chat that asked last) and the path that answers it,
which is its source's own, and its answers in their one set of words (#1700). The Inbox lists
the asks oldest first, by when each began where its source knows. A chat's pane draws at most
two of its own asks as Notices, from the same list, so an answer in either place clears both
(#1695). The title bar's ✋ counts asks. Not an **Update**. A prompt in a
harness's terminal is answered from the window where the harness's hook can carry the answer (a
permission prompt of Claude Code, Codex or opencode); otherwise it is listed as waiting in its
terminal, naming the kind of prompt, with Go to chat.
_Avoid_: prompt (that is what the operator types), approval (that is one kind of answer)

**Inbox**:
The one place for everything that waits on the person: its **asks** first, then the project's
**Notices**, then its **updates** (spec #1688, #1695). The title bar's ✋ shows its count of asks,
and the status line's Notices button its count of Notices.
_Avoid_: queue, alerts, notifications

**Update**:
Something the person may want to know that waits on nothing: a task finished or failed, a doctor
finding, a chat that resumed, a sandbox change, a dispatch refused while nobody was there, a
Smart close that stopped, a report with nowhere to go, a commit refused (#1694). Listed in the
**Inbox** after the asks, newest first, and kept a day per
machine in purlis's data home, never in a project, so it survives a relaunch (#1693). Read and
dismissed one at a time or all at once (Mark all read, Dismiss all), and never counted on the ✋.
A task that failed is an update and not an **Ask**. Not an **Ask**.
_Avoid_: notification, news

**Kill switch**:
Stop all on the title bar, or `purlis stop --all`: every chat's and shell's program that purlis
started, in every project and window, is interrupted and ended, and no chat starts until the
operator **re-arms** it from the title bar. It is a stop, not a close: the tabs stay, each
reading as a chat whose program ended. A new shell still opens, so the operator can look around.
Nothing on the command line re-arms (ADR 0071).
_Avoid_: panic button, pause (nothing is resumed on re-arm)

**Shell tab**:
A tab running the operator's own shell, with no harness and no profile, opened by `New shell`.
A harness typed into one runs outside purlis's session tracking, so purlis's **shell-tab
shims** stand first on its `PATH`: the harness still starts, after one line saying so, and the
tab shows a banner offering to open it as a chat instead (ADR 0062).
_Avoid_: terminal (for the tab), console, plain chat

**Light editor**:
purlis's one editor, for reading a file of a chat's branch, making a small edit in it and
reviewing a diff. It has no language server, debugger, repo-wide refactor or extension code of
anyone else's; deep work opens in **your editor** at the same file and line. It is a view of a
**Workspace**'s repos (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0081).
_Avoid_: editor (unqualified), code editor, IDE (except in the category phrase "the agent IDE",
which is purlis as a whole)

**Your editor**:
The editor the operator already uses (VS Code, Zed, a JetBrains IDE, or `$EDITOR`), where writing
code by hand happens. purlis opens a file there at a line, and never replaces it. Which editor
is a setting of this machine, so it belongs to **Project** (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0081).
_Avoid_: external editor; IDE (except in the category phrase "the agent IDE")

**Comparison**:
A base and a head in one of a workspace's repos, which git turns into the diff a Review tab shows: a
chat's branch against its base, two refs, uncommitted work, one agent turn, a request. A
cross-repo change is one comparison per member. It is a part of a **Workspace** (ADR 0084).
_Avoid_: diff (for the pair; the diff is what git computes from it), changeset

**Review tab**:
A view tab showing one comparison (or one per member of a cross-repo change), where the operator
reads the diff, ticks files as viewed, comments on lines, and ends by sending the comments to the
chat, publishing them to the request, or approving. There is one per branch, and it remembers
where the operator was. The forge's own review of a request stays the review of record. "Review"
on its own is the plain verb, as on the chat tab's button, and is not a purlis noun. It is a view
of a **Workspace**'s repos (ADR 0084).
_Avoid_: Review (as a noun for the tab), code review (for purlis's), PR review (that is the
forge's), diff view

**Review draft**:
A Review tab's unsent comments: each one's line and the operator's words, never code. Only the
window writes it, it is kept on this machine and travels with the operator's other machines,
and it leaves only by **Send to agent**, **Publish** or being kept. It belongs to **Workspace**
(ADR 0084).
_Avoid_: pending review (that is GitHub's), draft (unqualified)

**Human edit**:
An edit the operator saved to a file in a chat's branch from the light editor. purlis records
which file and lines, and announces it to the chat's harness at its next turn: one line of
context naming the files edited since its last turn, paths only, never contents. Edits from
several sittings add up until that turn, and the announcement is never a prompt sent for the
operator. It is a part of a **Chat**'s history (ADR 0084).
_Avoid_: manual edit, override

**Session record**:
A summary a chat writes of its own session when it closes through **Smart close** — its goal,
what it did, what it decided, what is still open and how to pick it up — filed as one file in
its workspace's `sessions/` (the plane's own, at the plane root). The chat gives the title and
the five sections; purlis gives everything else (which chat, persona, harness, profile,
conversation, workspace, directory and pieces), keeps the index and `workspace.md`'s one `## Sessions` line, and names
the newest in the next chat's briefing (ADR 0064).
_Avoid_: handoff, log, transcript

**Smart close**:
Closing a chat after it has written its session record: the app sends it one line naming
purlis's `smart-close` skill (the operator's click is the consent, the exception to a curation
action's never-sent prompt), and the tab closes when `purlis session record` tells the app the
record is saved — never on anything the chat printed. Until then the chat is **wrapping up**:
its tab says so, and the operator's Cancel smart close or their own typing stops it.
_Avoid_: save and close, archive

**Smart-close pass**:
What a person's own start of a smart close gives that chat: the tab's **Smart close**, or the
person typing `/smart-close` into a waiting chat. It is bound to that chat and that close, ends
with it, and is the only thing that lets a record close the tab. A chat can't give itself one: a
typed `/smart-close` counts only beside the person's own Enter in the chat's pane (#1332).
_Avoid_: token, ticket (that is a handoff's), approval

**Resume** (of a session record):
Starting a NEW chat from a session record, in the record's place — the directory it ran in,
where that is still in the place — on its harness and the profile it ran on where this machine
still has it, given its conversation where the harness can still find it, and with the record
quoted in its briefing. What it had to guess instead, it says.
Where the conversation cannot be given it is a fresh chat with the record, and it says why. It
never reopens the chat that wrote the record.
_Avoid_: reopen, restore (a relaunch reopens the chats that were open)

**Plane updated** (of a chat):
A chat started before the plane's start-time instructions (`CLAUDE.md`, the harness settings
and sub-agents, a persona's charter) changed on disk. It runs on what it read until it is
started fresh, and its tab carries a quiet mark saying so. It is not a needs-you item.
_Avoid_: stale, behind, outdated, Incoming (that is the remote's commits)

### Saving

**Save**:
Taking what changed in the plane or a repo as far as its mode allows: commit, push, PR, merge.
_Avoid_: sync (that word is `purlis sync`'s), commit (a save may be more than one), publish

**Sync**:
Fetching every clone in a workspace and fast-forwarding the ones that hold no work:
`purlis sync`, and *Sync repos* in the window. Nothing else is called Sync: not a save, not
moving a project to its pinned version, not writing persona sub-agents, and not any state kept
between devices (ADR 0072).
_Avoid_: pull, refresh, update (for this)

**Mode**:
How far a save goes: `off`, `commit`, `push`, `pr` or `pr-merge`. Each value includes the
steps of the one before it. The plane has one mode, and each repo has its own.
_Avoid_: policy, posture, share

**Auto-save**:
A save purlis starts by itself: after a quiet period, when a session ends, or when the app
quits.
_Avoid_: sync, background push

**Target branch**:
The branch a save is meant to end up on.
_Avoid_: base branch, main (it need not be)

**Save branch**:
The one branch per clone of the plane (named for the machine and the clone) that the plane's
request modes push to, carrying one open request into the target branch.
_Avoid_: PR branch, `charter/<sha>` branch

**Request mode**:
A save mode that keeps one request open into the target branch instead of pushing to it: `pr`,
and `pr-merge`, which also sets the request to auto-merge.
Prose says "request mode" on every forge; `pr` and `pr-merge` stay the words `charter.toml` takes
(V81).
_Avoid_: PR mode, MR mode

**Stage**:
Where unsaved work sits. It is *changed* (not committed), *committed* (not pushed), *pushed*
(PR open), or *saved* (on the target branch).
_Avoid_: status, sync state

**Blocked**:
A save that can't go further without a person: a conflict or a merge or rebase git stopped
part-way, a refused push, a secret the scan caught, a mode the remote can't take. Auto-save pauses until it's cleared.
_Avoid_: failed, error, stuck

**Incoming**:
Commits on the remote that this machine doesn't have yet.
_Avoid_: behind (in UI text)

**Commit scan**:
The check a chat's own commit passes before git makes it: the lines it adds, scanned for keys
and personal data, and refused with each finding masked. `purlis scan` runs it on what is
staged. Part of Workspace, as a check on a repo's save (ADR 0074).
_Avoid_: secret scan (that is the plane save's), leak check

**Allowlist** (of the commit scan):
A repo's `.charter-scan-allow.toml`: the findings the commit scan lets through, each entry with
its reason, committed by the operator and read as it is at `HEAD`. A setting of a repo.
_Avoid_: ignore list, exceptions, whitelist

**Shared / Local** (settings):
Where a setting's value comes from: `charter.toml` (committed, the team's) or
`charter.local.toml` (this machine's). A Local value overrides the Shared one key by key.
In Settings a value says which it comes from, and "Shared / Only on this machine" moves it
between the two.
_Avoid_: global/user, project/personal

**Settings**:
The one tab where every setting of purlis is read and changed, at one level at a time. Each
group of settings has its own place in it, and anything that tells you to change a setting can
open it at that place. Opening it from a project or a workspace opens it at that level.
_Avoid_: Preferences, options, config page, project settings page (as a separate thing)

**Level** (of settings):
Whose setting it is: **You** (this machine, for every project), **Project**, **Workspace** or
**Persona**. A level's value overrides the one beneath it, and each value says which level and
which file it came from.
_Avoid_: scope (that word is kept off settings), layer, tier (tiers are where stores live)

### The sandbox

**Brokered write**:
A write to the project's own files that a sandboxed chat asks purlis to make for it: a session
record, memory, todos, `workspace.md`, persona files, a workspace or handoff made, and the
clone, checkout or worktree a sandbox would refuse. purlis makes it as the terminal would, and
the chat's sandbox does not widen. A chat writing one of those files itself is refused and told
which tool to use. A change to `workspace.md` or a persona charter shows a **Notice** with Review
and Revert (ADR 0067 §2).
_Avoid_: escalation, unsandboxed write, proxy write

**Internet access**:
Which hosts a sandboxed chat can reach: readable presets ("AI providers", "Code hosting",
"Package registries"), each listing its hosts, plus the project's own hosts and your personal
ones. The project's choice is committed and every teammate follows it; a host nothing allows is
blocked and shown (ADR 0067 §1, §3).
_Avoid_: hosts it may reach, egress (in UI text), allowlist (that is the commit scan's), network
policy

**Open hosts**:
The hosts every sandboxed chat in a project reaches without asking: each **Internet access**
preset's hosts and the project's own hosts. Settings' Network page spells them out host by host
(spec #1661).
_Avoid_: allowlist, egress (in UI text), default hosts

**Persona hosts**:
The hosts only one persona's chats reach, once the person has allowed that persona's list on
this machine. The project commits the list with the persona; each machine allows it on its own.
_Avoid_: persona grants (in UI text), persona allowlist

**Allowed host**:
A person's yes to one host and port at one scope: *this chat*, *this project on this machine*,
or *everyone in the project*, which is committed so teammates follow it. It is shown in full,
never as a wildcard, and every one can be removed from Settings' Network page.
_Avoid_: grant (in UI text; that is a runner's **Grant**), exception, allowlist entry

**Block**:
One refused reach: a sandboxed chat was refused a host and port, a local socket, a lookup or a
file. purlis records the chat, what was refused, the time and why in this machine's network
record, kept 30 days and never committed, shows a **Notice** on the chat's tab, and lists it
under Blocked lately.
_Avoid_: denial, violation (that is the sandbox's own report), egress refusal

**Policy**:
An admin's locks on settings, kept on this machine or for the organisation. A locked value
cannot be changed at any **level**, the strictest value wins, and Settings shows it as "locked
by policy". It never loosens what a project or a person sets. One that forbids the opt-out
requires the sandbox in every project on that machine, which Settings shows as "On, required by
policy" (ADR 0067 §1, §4 as amended).
_Avoid_: supervisor, managed tier (in UI text; that is a harness vendor's), org settings

### Core and extensions

**Core**:
What purlis does itself, on every platform, with no extension on. A plane's instructions and
the session-start briefing may depend only on the core.
_Avoid_: built-ins (for core features), platform

**Extension**:
A directory the operator installs and approves on this machine, whose manifest declares what it
contributes and which capabilities it asks for. Its program runs as the operator, one question
at a time.
_Avoid_: plugin, add-on, module

**Built-in extension**:
An extension that ships inside the app and is trusted through the app's signature rather than
an approval prompt. A copy of one anywhere else is an ordinary extension.
_Avoid_: bundled plugin, first-party plugin, core extension

**Capability**:
One thing purlis does for an extension that asked for it in its manifest and was approved,
such as showing a badge or adding a CLI command. It describes purlis's conduct, never a limit
on the extension.
_Avoid_: permission, grant (that is a runner's **Grant**), power

**Facts file**:
A file an extension keeps in its own state directory, holding the values purlis shows for it
(badges, repo cells) without starting its program.
_Avoid_: cache, status file

**Event**:
One question purlis asks an extension after a core action it hears about has finished, such as
a workspace being created or the plane being saved. What it answers never changes the action.
_Avoid_: hook (for this), notification, subscription

**Briefing section**:
Text an extension adds to a chat's session-start briefing, quoted as data under the
extension's name. It is never an instruction, and never a permission, a hook or a setting.
_Avoid_: prompt, context injection

**Action** (of an extension):
A verb an extension declares and offers on the rows of its views: pressing one asks its program
to *run action `<id>` on `<subject>`*. Never one of purlis's own verbs. purlis asks first when
the manifest says so, and always before one that deletes.
_Avoid_: command (for this), verb (unqualified), button

**Curation action**:
A chat purlis opens on a workspace, a persona or the plane with a prompt already typed into it
and never sent: the operator reads it and presses Enter. purlis ships three of its own
(`charter/safe-remove`, `charter/compact`, `charter/add-curation-action`), and a persona
declares more as `personas/<name>/curation/<id>.md`, which that persona runs. Unlike an
extension's **Action**, nothing runs a program: the chat is the whole of it (ADR 0061).
_Avoid_: action (unqualified), quick action, macro

**Palette command** (of an extension):
A row an extension adds to the palette, named with the extension's name, that opens one of its
views or runs one of its actions.
_Avoid_: shortcut, menu item

**Extension command**:
A command an extension adds to the `purlis` command line, run as `purlis <extension id>
<command> …`. It says whether it writes, and what its program prints and its exit status reach
the caller unchanged. An extension's id is never one of purlis's own command words.
_Avoid_: subcommand (unqualified), plugin command, palette command (for this)

**Core-owned alias**:
A core command whose words forward to an extension command and give its output, so a plane's
instructions keep working when a feature moves into an extension (`purlis ws todo` once todos
does).
_Avoid_: shim, redirect

**Write paths**:
The plane-relative paths an extension declares it writes. purlis hands them resolved with
each request and reports a change outside them; it does not stop one.
_Avoid_: sandbox, allowed paths, scope (as if enforced)

**Harness adapter**:
purlis code that arms one harness through its own mechanism for one chat, with nothing written
into the harness's config: what level 2 and a harness's own protocol need. It never stands in for
the harness's program (ADRs 0050, 0073).
_Avoid_: wrapper, driver, plugin (that is the harness's)

**ACP adapter program**:
A program the user installs that speaks ACP for a harness that does not, such as
`claude-agent-acp` or `codex-acp`. purlis spawns it as a level-3 chat's program, found by name
on `PATH`, and never ships, downloads or updates one. It is not a harness adapter, which is
purlis's code (ADRs 0073, 0080).
_Avoid_: ACP adapter (on its own), harness adapter (for this), bridge

**Wrap**:
To run a chat's unmodified harness inside a sandbox profile or backend purlis generates (ADR
0067). Never to **stand in** for the harness: putting purlis's own program where the harness's
is expected and changing what it or its model sees, which purlis never does. X34's *"wraps a
harness binary"* means standing in (ADR 0073).
_Avoid_: wrap (for a stand-in, a shim or an adapter)

**Harness plugin**:
A Claude Code, Codex or opencode plugin, chosen per project. "Plugin" on its own always means
this, never a purlis extension. purlis's own is one too: the Claude Code plugin the app
bundles, named `purlis` (`purlis@inline`, skills `purlis:<skill>`, MCP tools
`mcp__purlis__<tool>`), always on in the chats the app starts. Its ids from before the rename
(`charter@inline`, `charter-app@inline`, `charter@charter-app`) are always off there, and so
is the Python charter's `charter@charter`. `purlis plugin install` puts a copy of it,
`purlis@purlis-app`, in front of the chats the operator starts outside the app (ADR 0057). For opencode, purlis's own is the **opencode
shim**, a script the app loads into each opencode chat it starts, and whose guard-only variant
`purlis plugin install` writes into opencode's plugin directory (ADR 0058).
_Avoid_: extension (for this); "purlis plugin" for anything but purlis's own

**purlis's skills**:
The skills in purlis's plugin (`skills/` in the bundle), one source for every harness. Each
harness is handed them by its own route, for the chat alone: Claude Code loads the plugin,
opencode is told the directory through the shim, and a Codex chat is **briefed** on them, a list
of names, descriptions and `SKILL.md` paths at `SessionStart` (ADR 0063).
_Avoid_: "Claude Code skills" for these; a copy of them anywhere

**Vault**:
A named set of secrets purlis keeps in the system keyring and hands to a command, never to
the model and never to an extension. Vaults are core.
_Avoid_: secret store, keychain (as the name of the concept)

**Forge extension**:
An extension about a code host's pull requests, merge requests or issues, which reaches the
forge through `gh` or `glab`'s own login and never through a secret purlis hands it. Once
PE-29 opens the forge seam to extensions, it asks purlis to make the call instead (ADR 0070).
_Avoid_: forge plugin, GitHub integration

**Editor integration**:
purlis's own extension for VS Code or Zed, or its own plugin for JetBrains IDEs: installed in
**your editor**, it opens a file's chat in purlis, sends a selection to a chat's prompt for the
operator to send, and shows a chat's changes. It speaks the **editor protocol**, and is neither a
purlis **extension** nor a **harness plugin**. It is a view of a **Workspace** and its chats,
drawn in your editor (ADR 0072 §2, ADR 0081).
_Avoid_: extension or plugin (on their own), IDE plugin

### How purlis is built

**Dev channel build**:
The build a green `main` publishes to the dev channel: compiled with the lighter `dev-release`
profile, and with no `.dmg`. It is signed, checked and isolated exactly as a stable build is,
and it is for trying a change, never for measuring one (ADR 0092).
_Avoid_: nightly, debug build, fast build

**Stable build**:
The build a `v*` tag publishes to the stable channel: compiled with Cargo's `release` profile,
with every bundle. Every performance budget is measured on this profile (ADR 0042, ADR 0092).
_Avoid_: release build (that is the profile, and both channels' builds are releases of a kind),
production build

**Profile guard**:
The nightly build of `main` with the stable build's profile and bundles. It holds no signing key
and publishes nowhere, and a failure opens one issue or rewrites it. It is what shows the stable
build still works now that the dev channel no longer uses its profile (ADR 0092).
_Avoid_: nightly release, canary, stable dry run
