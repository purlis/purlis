# A plugin is a subprocess, or purlis has no plugins

The operator decided on 2026-09-22 that purlis becomes a pluggable platform with a plugin
runtime that runs third-party code. The recommendation given was *not now*; the decision went the
other way and is not re-litigated here. What was agreed alongside it is that **the threat model
gates the runtime**, and this is that model. It says where third-party code may run, what it may
reach, how it is installed and trusted, why a theme is not any of those things, and — numbered at
the end — what has to be true before a line of runtime ships.

The work is purlis's. The record is here because `0001`–`0040` are here and a decision about
purlis's trust boundary kept in the other repository would split the sequence; ADR 0031 made the
same move for the same reason. Every path below (`crates/purlis-core/…`, `app/src-tauri/…`,
`app/src/…`) is in `diazoxide/charter` and every bare `#nnn` is an issue there.

**Built and shipping, through the gate below** (status brought up to date 2026-10-11, #1368). The
executor, the `views`, `actions` and `writes` capabilities, events, commands and facts files are
in the app, and the amendments of 2026-09-23 to 2026-10-09 say what each one built and how the
gate was taken item by item. The operator accepted the extensions plan E1–E10 that builds on this
record on 2026-09-29. The record itself has no recorded sign-off beyond that, and the stage 2
amendment says so of itself.

When it was written, nothing in this record was implemented. It was a gate, written before the
thing it gates, which is the only order in which a gate is worth anything.

## The irony is load-bearing, so it goes first

purlis's whole M3 milestone is a guard that stands between a model and a credential. Its
state today, read off the tree rather than remembered:

- `charter hook pretooluse` is **one switch**. `crates/purlis-cli/src/main.rs`'s `is_a_tool_hook`
  answers every word in the `pretooluse`/`posttooluse` namespace with exit 2 — which a harness
  reads as *block* — and `crates/purlis-cli/tests/hook.rs` pins that behaviour.
- Three of six stages are in the tree and **each one is wired to nothing, deliberately**.
  `shellseg.rs` ("This module is stage 1 and is wired to nothing"), `heredoc.rs` and
  `shellwrap.rs` ("stage 2 of six and is wired to nothing"), `leakguard.rs` ("This is stage 3 of
  six and is wired to nothing"). Each header gives the same reason: the first partial
  implementation to flip the switch turns fail-closed into
  allow-everything-except-the-part-that-is-ported, so the switch moves in the last PR and nowhere
  earlier.
- #92 measured the size of what is left: A7 alone has a transitive closure of **60 definitions and
  2,138 lines**, 41 of them (68%) shared with the leak guard.

So purlis is at its safest on this axis precisely because the guard has never run. A plugin
runtime would put third-party code inside the process that is going to host that guard, and it
would do it through a path that has no hook in it at all: a plugin does not call a tool, so
`pretooluse` never sees it, whatever stage it reaches. **A plugin is not a thing the tool guard
can be extended to cover. It is a second door beside the one being built.** That is the sentence
this record exists to make un-forgettable, and it is why the finished guard is item 2 of the gate
rather than a nice-to-have.

## Four existing records, and what they actually say

Each of the four this decision rests on was re-read for this document. Three say what the brief
for this work said they say. One does not, and the difference matters.

**[ADR 0022](https://github.com/diazoxide/charter-plane/blob/0ae0961d8a6a8e59b48ba43b10d28de8fd87afb7/docs/adr/0022-a-harness-profile-belongs-to-one-machine.md) — a harness profile is
machine-local so that a committed file cannot decide how a chat launches.** Correct, and the
reason is worth quoting because it transfers wholesale: *"Between pressing `+` and `os.execvpe`
there is no harness permission prompt, no tool call a guard could deny, nothing that shows a
human the words about to be run."* A plugin contributing a palette command is exactly that, one
level up: a click, and something runs.

One thing the summary of 0022 leaves out, and it cuts against the simple reading. **The
2026-09-15 amendment made a launch a writer of code into a config folder.** Where a profile's
probe finds a definite unwired answer, the launch now installs `charter@charter` into the
folder that profile names — no second question, because *"the approval prompt already stands for
the command, and a second yes about the plugin would be asking permission to enforce the rule."*
So the precedent is not "purlis never installs anything". It is: purlis installs exactly the
thing that makes a chat guarded, into exactly the folder an approved profile names, and says one
line about it. A plugin install is the opposite case on both halves — it is not the guard, and the
folder is purlis's own.

**[ADR 0035](0035-a-plane-is-untrusted-until-the-operator-opens-it.md) — a plane is untrusted
until the operator opens it, and the trust record fingerprints what it contributes.** Correct, and
this is the shape to follow. Read off the code rather than the record: `layer.rs:63` is
`const WORKSPACE_KEYS: [&str; 2] = ["enabledPlugins", "env"]` and `layer.rs:71` is
`const RESTRICTIVE: [&str; 2] = ["ask", "deny"]`; `machine.rs`'s `Contribution` fingerprints those
two travelling keys, the restrictive rules, and the programs `.charter/app/reopen.json` would
start, with `starts` and `profiles` held apart *because only one of them is a grant*.

Two corrections. First, **`enabledPlugins` is Claude Code's plugin list, not purlis's.** The word
"plugin" is already spoken for inside this exact threat model and inside the exact dialog a
purlis plugin would have to appear in. A first-open prompt that says *this project enables 3
plugins* and *this machine has 2 plugins installed*, meaning two unrelated things, is a consent
surface that has stopped being read. Whatever purlis's own extension is called, it is not called
a plugin in that dialog.

Second, **the approval path 0035 describes has two open defects, and a plugin trust record built
on it inherits both**:

- **#112** — `layer::readable_text` is an unbounded `read_to_string` with no `O_NOFOLLOW`, and
  `Contribution::of` calls it against a *stranger's* plane at approval time. A FIFO there blocks
  the approval before the app has a window; a symlink at the exact leaf is followed.
- **#123** — the contribution shown in the dialog and the record `put_back` executes are **two
  separate reads**. A write between them is executed without having been shown. The issue names
  its own fix: `Contribution::of` already reads the record, so handing back the bytes it read
  closes the window by construction.

Both are bounded by 0035's own limit — the fingerprint is *"not a defence against an agent that
set out to forge the fingerprint"* — and neither is a reason to distrust the gate. They are a
reason not to copy it before they are closed.

**[ADR 0028](0028-containment-checks-a-path-and-does-not-hold-it.md) — containment checks a path
and does not hold it; the race is accepted and named.** Correct. The paragraph that matters here
is not the measurement, it is the re-opening clause:

> A confined agent would be in the model, and purlis does not have one. The honest version of the
> third answer is conditional: the race is out of scope *because* nothing in purlis makes an agent
> less privileged than purlis itself. The moment something does … this decision is the first thing
> that has to be re-opened.

A plugin runtime is that moment, arriving from the other direction. The whole proposition of a
plugin boundary is that a plugin is *less* privileged than purlis. If that is true, then the
accepted race stops being an accident nobody can exploit without already having the operator's
shell: it becomes a way for a confined principal to have purlis write purlis's own bytes to a
path the plugin chose. Whether the boundary is real enough to trip that clause is the single
sharpest question about anything below, and the answer in this record is that it is **not real
enough yet** — see the honesty paragraph under decision 1.

**[ADR 0031](0031-windows-gets-charters-guards-or-it-gets-no-charter.md) — a guard that cannot be
expressed on a platform refuses rather than degrades.** The rule is right and this record leans on
it hard. **When this record was written 0031 was marked `DRAFT — this needs the operator's
sign-off before anything is built on it`, and the decision in it was described by its own text as
a proposal.** Citing it as settled would have been citing a proposal as a precedent, which is how
a record acquires authority nobody granted it. So its sign-off was made item 1 of the gate.

**The operator signed 0031 off as written on 2026-09-22**, the same day this record was drafted
and because this record raised it — the decision, the evidence, the issue list and the estimate
all unchanged. Item 1 is met and the lean is legitimate. The history is kept rather than tidied
away, because it is the only part of this that generalises: the rule had been quoted as settled
in several briefs while it was a proposal, and nothing but a reader checking the file caught it.

## Decision 1 — plugin code runs in a subprocess, over a protocol

The five candidates, and what a compromised plugin reaches under each. The surface every one of
them is measured against is `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`'s `collect_commands![…]`: **forty
commands**, among them `send_input` (keystrokes into any chat's pty), `watch_session` (every byte
any chat produces), `worktree_remove` and `worktree_merge`, `start_chat`, `approve_plane`,
`pin_chat`, `quit`.

**The main webview — ruled out.** A plugin there reaches all forty, because Tauri's IPC has no
per-caller identity *inside* one webview: `app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`
grants `core:default`, `opener:default` and `notification:default` to the window, and purlis's
own commands are reachable by anything executing in it. The only thing keeping foreign script out
of that window today is `tauri.conf.json`'s
`"csp": "default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"`, and a plugin is local by
construction — loading one is the precise thing that CSP exists to prevent, done deliberately. DX
is the best of the five and the isolation is zero, which is the combination this repository's
priority order is most likely to mistake for a good trade.

**A Web Worker — ruled out, and the reason is written down because this is the cheap answer
everybody reaches for.** A worker has no DOM. It has the same origin, and `invoke` works from it.
So it isolates a plugin from the surface that does not matter (pixels) and not at all from the
surface that does (the forty commands). It would *read* as isolation to every later reviewer while
being a naming convention. A boundary that looks like one and is not is worse than no boundary,
which is 0022's sentence about a chat that looks guarded and is not, applied to a process.

**A second Tauri webview — ruled out as "the protocol, plus a browser".** This one is real: Tauri
capabilities are per-window, so a plugin window can be granted a different permission set. But
capabilities gate *Tauri's* plugin permissions, not purlis's own `#[tauri::command]`s, which are
registered on the app and would each need a gate written by hand — which is the protocol, written
in a harder place. Meanwhile a second WebKit view costs memory against ADR 0026's limits for the
benefit of a boundary that still has to be hand-built inside it.

**WASM with an explicit import surface — right eventually, wrong first.** It is the only option
that makes the capability list *enforced by construction*: no ambient authority, no syscalls, an
import table that is the grant. Two costs. DX is the worst of the five, and DX is priority 1 here
(ADR 0025): a plugin author compiles a toolchain, a stack trace is an offset, and `println!`
debugging needs a host function before it works. And — the part that is usually missed — WASM
gives you the *enforcement* of a capability list for free and **none of the design of it**. The
hard problem below is deciding what the capabilities are; WASM does not help with that and cannot
be adopted until it is answered. It is the right answer for the day a plugin must be fast and
hot-reloadable, and that day is not the first day.

**A subprocess speaking a protocol — the recommendation.** Four reasons, in this repository's own
priority order:

1. **DX (priority 1).** A plugin is a program. It runs in a terminal, takes a debugger, prints to
   its own stderr, and its whole conversation with purlis is a log a human can read. Every other
   option debugs worse, and an isolation model nobody can debug gets routed around — which is the
   failure mode this decision is most exposed to.
2. **Standard practice (priority 2).** LSP, DAP and MCP are all this shape. The repository's own
   rule is *never build custom tooling where a standard tool exists*, and a line-delimited
   request/response over a local socket is the most standard thing in this space.
3. **The machinery is already here, guards included.** `hookwire` binds a unix socket and sets it
   `0600` (`hookwire.rs:292`), inside a directory created `0700` at creation rather than
   chmod-ed afterwards, with a review-found defect already fixed there (the earlier version
   created the directory at the umask and discarded the result of tightening it). And its Windows
   arm is **already a refusal** — `bind` and `send` return `Unsupported`, because Rust's standard
   library exposes no `AF_UNIX` there and a socket file has no mode bit to set. That is ADR 0031's
   rule already applied once, in the exact code a plugin channel would reuse.
4. **The OS supplies the part purlis cannot write.** The workspace is `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, so
   a Windows DACL is out of reach today (0031, #98) and so is anything else that needs a raw
   syscall. A process boundary is the one boundary purlis gets without writing `unsafe`.

What it costs, stated: a round trip instead of a call, and one process per plugin. The nearest
measured number in the tree is `hookwire`'s own — *"the 1.8 ms the whole hook call was measured
at"* — and that is a different shape of call, one line in one direction with no answer. **A plugin
round trip is unmeasured**, and measuring it is a precondition of fixing the protocol, not
something to do afterwards. It is affordable because a plugin is not on the terminal's hot path;
and the day a plugin *wants* the hot path, the answer is to refuse, not to move it in-process.

### The honesty paragraph, which is the most important one here

**A subprocess does not confine a plugin below the operator.** It runs as the same user, with the
same filesystem, the same network and the same ability to `exec`. It can read `.charter/vaults/`,
write the machine store, and edit `charter.local.toml` without asking purlis for anything. The
protocol bounds **what purlis will do on the plugin's behalf**; it does not bound what the plugin
can do itself.

Everything in decision 2 is therefore a statement about purlis's own conduct, not a cage. Saying
otherwise would be the exact error `SECURITY.md` refuses to make about the vault guard — *"a
guard against mistakes, not an attacker with shell access as your user"* — and `profiletrust.rs`
refuses to make about its own record. Real confinement is a sandbox: Seatbelt on macOS, seccomp or
Landlock on Linux, AppContainer on Windows. Each is a platform-specific piece of work, at least
one of them needs `unsafe` or a vetted crate, and none of them is costed. Until one exists, **a
plugin is trusted code that purlis is polite to**, and the trust decision at install time is
carrying the entire weight. That is why decision 3 is long and decision 2 is short.

## Decision 2 — the capability surface, enumerated honestly

"Grantable" below means *purlis will do this for a plugin that asked and was approved*. It never
means *a plugin cannot do this otherwise*; see the paragraph above.

| Surface | What it is, in the code | Grantable? | What a grant means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The DOM, the window's pixels | one webview, `app/src/` | **No, ever** | A theme reaches appearance as data. Code never reaches the tree purlis draws consent prompts into. |
| Tauri commands, as a set | the forty in `collect_commands!` | **No** | There is no grant called "the commands". Each is its own grant or it is not one. |
| A chat's output bytes | `watch_session` | Yes, **per chat**, revocable, visible while live | The highest-value grant in the table: a transcript carries whatever the operator pasted in. Never per plane, never standing. |
| Typing into a chat | `send_input` | Yes, but **not in the minimum set** | A keystroke into a shell with the operator's hands' authority. Per chat, time-bounded, shown while held. |
| The plane on disk | `plane.rs`, `workspaces.rs`, `personas.rs` | Not as "the plane" | A plugin gets what the protocol hands it. "Read the plane" is not a capability, it is the absence of one. |
| The machine store | `machine.rs`, `$CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME/charter/` | **No, at any level** | It is where purlis records *what it may open without asking*. A write there is a forged approval for a project, which is a program that starts at the next launch. |
| `.charter/app/reopen.json` | `reopen.rs` | **No, at any level** | `reopen.rs` says it: *"a way to have a command run at every later launch — before any window, with nothing to click"*, and `program`, `args` and `cwd` are **not checked at all**. |
| Harness profiles | `charter.local.toml`, `profiletrust.rs` | **No** | ADR 0022's entire argument. A plugin that can write a profile has written a command line. |
| The harness environment | `layer.rs` `WORKSPACE_KEYS` | **No** | ADR 0022 measured where it lands: *"A variable set on the harness process reaches the shell the model runs."* 0022 already refuses `KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD` in a profile's own `env`. |
| The network | — | **Declared, not granted** | purlis cannot enforce it on a subprocess. It is shown in the prompt as a claim the plugin makes about itself, and the record must say that it is a claim. |
| Vaults | `.charter/vaults/` | **Absent** | Not "denied". There is no capability name for it and there must not be one, because a name is a thing a later grant can be attached to. |

**The machine store and `reopen.json` are execution inputs, and the record proves it.** #129 was a
test suite writing 49 chats into the operator's live plane, because `plane::find_root` walking up
from a test process answered with the real plane; the fix (#132) is a compile-time fence that
panics if a resolved, opened, read or written plane — or the machine store — is outside
`$CHARTER_PLANE_FENCE`. A fence exists for those paths because writing them is running something.
Nothing a plugin is granted may touch either.

**The minimum viable capability set is two things, and neither is a capability in the runtime
sense:**

1. **Contribute a theme** — declarative data against a closed vocabulary. See below.
2. **Contribute a named palette command that, when the operator invokes it, sends one request to
   the plugin and displays the text that comes back.** This is the smallest thing that is
   executable at all: no ambient read, no standing subscription, one round trip per deliberate
   human action, and an answer that lands in a surface purlis controls.

Everything else waits for a plugin that exists and wants it, and the want is written down before
the capability is. A capability invented for a hypothetical plugin is a grant nobody audited
against a real use.

## Decision 3 — how a plugin is installed and trusted

**A plugin never travels in a plane.** ADR 0022's argument applies one level up and applies
*harder*. A harness profile at least has to survive the approval prompt before it runs; a plugin
that contributed a palette command would run on a click, which is the very gap 0022 opens with. A
`[plugin.<name>]` table in `charter.toml` is refused by name, exactly as
`[harness.<name>]` is. This also settles the collision noted above: a project cannot bring a
purlis extension with it, so the trust dialog's two uses of the word "plugin" never appear in the
same list.

**A plugin is machine state, and it has to argue for that.** ADR 0034's rule is that a fact may
live outside every plane *only when it is about the operator or the machine and is false inside
any one plane*, with "four things, and nothing else" — and ADR 0040 already made it five by
arguing rather than appending. A plugin list is the **sixth** and here is its argument: which
plugins this machine has, and what the operator approved each to do, is about the machine, is
false inside any one plane, and passes 0034's own test — *deleting this file must cost the
operator their arrangement and their approvals and nothing else*. It does, provided **a plugin's
own data never lives in the store**. A plugin is re-installable by name; its state is its own
problem, kept wherever it likes, and purlis's store holds a path, a fingerprint and an approval.

**Installed by path, by the operator, from nowhere.** No registry, no marketplace, no fetch by
name. The moment purlis resolves a plugin name over the network it owns a supply chain, and
priority 2 (standard practice) has no standard answer for that which fits a tool with one
operator. `purlis harness add` was rejected in 0022 on the grounds that *"a chat can run a
command as easily as it can edit a file, so the command could never stand for the operator's
approval of what it wrote"*; the same sentence forbids `purlis plugin install <name>` as a
consent step. What stands for consent is the prompt, and nothing else.

**Trust is 0035's shape, with one difference that costs something.** Show what it contributes, ask
once per human per machine, remember the fingerprint, re-ask when what it contributes changes. The
difference: **0035 fingerprints configuration and this fingerprints code.** A plugin's path is not
its contents, so the fingerprint has to be a hash of the executable and of every file it declares,
checked at each launch. That is real work at startup for a real reason — a plugin that rewrites
itself after approval is the attack this whole record is about — and the cost is named here rather
than discovered when the app gets slower.

**Every unreadable state means ask.** `profiletrust.rs`'s opening rule, word for word: a missing
file, a malformed one, an entry that is not a fingerprint, a link, a FIFO, a planted giant — each
reads as "no record", never as approval. *Treating silence as a yes is the one state this record
exists to keep out.*

**And it is not a boundary**, for the reason both `profiletrust.rs` and 0035 state about
themselves: a chat that can write the record can forge it. What the ask closes is the accident, the
plugin installed to see what it did, the one whose update changed what it contributes. It is the
difference between code that ran unseen and code that was read out loud first, and nothing here
should be built as though it were more.

## Themes are the first extension point, and a theme is not a plugin

A theme is declarative data with no executable surface: a file of semantic tokens that purlis
turns into CSS custom properties and into xterm's theme object — which today is hard-coded, one
literal, at `app/src/SessionPane.tsx:54`:
`theme: { background: "#181818", foreground: "#d8d8d8" }`. It is the ideal first extension point
because it has a bounded vocabulary purlis already owns, a real consumer on day one, and nothing
to isolate.

**What makes a declarative extension safe is four properties, and it is safe only while it has all
four:**

1. **The vocabulary is closed and purlis decides it.** The extension fills in values for names
   purlis published; it cannot introduce a name.
2. **The value space is not a program.** A colour, a number, a member of an enumeration. Nothing
   whose evaluation is an action.
3. **purlis chooses the consumer.** purlis decides that this token becomes that CSS custom
   property and that xterm field. The theme never names a destination.
4. **purlis parses and re-emits, never interpolates.** A token's text is read into a typed value
   and a fresh string is written out from that value. The theme's bytes never reach a stylesheet.
   An unknown or malformed entry is dropped with a reason and the default stands.

**The line a plugin crosses when it stops being data** — three crossings, each of which turns
property 4 or property 1 into a lie, and each of which will be proposed by somebody reasonable:

- **A value that reaches a CSS context purlis did not choose.** `url(…)` inside a token is a fetch
  from the app's origin, which is the CSP's whole job. Parse-and-re-emit is the rule that makes
  this unreachable rather than filtered; a blocklist of CSS functions is the version of this rule
  that fails.
- **Any way of saying *where*.** A selector, a rule, a media query, an element name. A theme says
  what a semantic token is worth. The moment it says where a token applies it is choosing
  purlis's layout, and there is no bounded vocabulary left to check against.
- **A reference to a file.** A font path, a background image, an `@import`. Every one of them is a
  read of a path the extension chose, which is a capability wearing a theme's clothes.

**And one that is not obvious: a theme is data and it is still an input to a decision.** A theme
that paints the *needs you* state the same as idle hides a chat that is waiting. A theme that makes
the refusal button in the first-open dialog look like the accept button is an attack on a consent
prompt, delivered entirely in legal data. So the closed vocabulary has a floor: **the consent
surfaces and the state colours are purlis's, not the theme's**, and a contrast minimum is
enforced on what the theme does get. A declarative extension is safe from *code execution* by
construction; it is not automatically safe from *deception*, and those are different properties
that this document keeps apart.

## What to build first, and none of it needs the runtime

This is the most useful part of the record. Each item is worth shipping on its own merits, and
each one is something the runtime would otherwise have to invent badly while under pressure.

1. **Theme-as-data**, with the closed vocabulary, the parse-and-re-emit rule, the consent surfaces
   excluded, and the contrast floor. Already being built; this record only adds the four properties
   and the three crossings.
2. **An extension registry with no executor.** One place that answers *what has contributed what to
   this window*, populated at first only by purlis's own built-ins and by themes. Every later
   decision here needs that list to exist, and building it now means the first plugin is not also
   the thing that invents it.
3. **Close #112 and #123.** The trust path is the foundation the plugin trust record would be poured
   on. Both are useful without any plugin and both are mandatory with one, and #123's fix is
   plumbing that already has its shape written in the issue.
4. **Finish the tool guard: stages 4, 5 and 6, with the switch in the last PR.** Gate item, not a
   backlog entry. Shipping a plugin runtime while `pretooluse` answers exit 2 to everything means
   running third-party code in a process whose own guard has never executed a line in anger.
5. **Show what is in force, after approval and not only at it.** ADR 0035 shows a project's
   contribution in the dialog and nothing shows it afterwards. A `doctor` row and a window
   affordance that lists the plugins enabled, the environment set, and the extensions loaded is
   the surface every later trust decision is read on.

## The gate: what has to be true before a line of runtime ships

Falsifiable, so that "are we ready" is a checklist and not a conversation.

1. **ADR 0031 is signed off.** **Met, 2026-09-22** — it was a `DRAFT` when this gate was written.
   Refuse-rather-than-degrade is the rule that stops the plugin boundary from being silently
   absent on a platform, and it could not be the backstop while it was a proposal.
2. **The tool guard is wired.** Stage 6 landed and `is_a_tool_hook`'s blanket exit 2 replaced by
   the real guard.
3. **#112 and #123 are closed**, and the plugin trust record reuses the fixed path rather than
   copying the current one.
4. **A named plugin exists that wants a capability the theme vocabulary cannot express**, and that
   capability is written down — in this sequence — before the runtime that serves it.
5. **The protocol refuses, per platform, every capability it cannot express there.** ADR 0031's
   rule, applied to the new surface, with `hookwire`'s Windows arm as the worked example.
6. **The trust record passes `profiletrust`'s test**: every unreadable state asks, and each of
   those states has a test that has been *seen to go red* with the guard removed — this
   repository's own standard, and the one it keeps missing.
7. **The subprocess's confinement is decided** — a sandbox, or explicitly not one, in writing. If
   not, **ADR 0028 is re-opened in the same PR**, because a plugin is the confined principal whose
   arrival 0028 names as the trigger for re-opening it. **Met, 2026-09-22** — the operator ruled
   *explicitly not one*; see the amendment at the end of this record, and ADR 0028's own
   amendment of the same date, which is the re-opening this item required.
8. **The plugin round trip is measured** against ADR 0026's limits before the protocol is fixed.
   `hookwire`'s 1.8 ms is a one-way line, not a round trip, and is not a substitute.

## What was rejected

- **The main webview, because it is easy.** It is forty commands and a deliberate hole in the CSP.
- **A Web Worker as isolation.** It isolates the DOM and not the command surface, and it would read
  as a boundary to every later reviewer.
- **A second Tauri webview.** Capabilities gate Tauri's permissions, not purlis's commands; the
  gate still has to be written, now inside a browser.
- **WASM first.** Worst DX of the five against priority 1, and it enforces a capability list it
  cannot help design. It stays the right answer for later.
- **A plugin travelling in a plane.** ADR 0022's argument, one level up, where the click has even
  less in front of it.
- **A registry or marketplace.** purlis would own a supply chain, and `purlis plugin install`
  could no more stand for approval than `purlis harness add` could.
- **A capability called "the plane" or "the filesystem".** Those are the absence of a capability
  model, named as though they were one.
- **Calling a theme a plugin.** It has no executable surface, it needs none of this machinery, and
  bundling them would hold a safe thing behind an unsafe one's gate.
- **Deferring the threat model until a plugin exists.** The threat model is the gate, and a gate
  built after the thing it gates is a description.

## Consequences

- **The first plugin is slower than a function call and nobody has measured by how much.** Stated
  as an open number rather than an estimate; gate item 8.
- **A subprocess is a second process to start, supervise and reap**, in an app whose session
  lifecycle is already the hardest part of it. `Planes`, `Chats` and the hook socket all learned
  this the expensive way, and a plugin host is a fourth thing with the same failure modes.
- **A plugin can do everything the operator can, and purlis's grants are purlis's manners.**
  Until a sandbox exists, the install-time decision carries the whole weight, and this record says
  so in three separate places on purpose.
- **The fingerprint is a hash of code, checked at each launch**, so a plugin makes launches slower
  in proportion to how many there are. ADR 0035's fingerprint reads two settings keys; this one
  reads an executable.
- **A theme cannot do something somebody will want**, and the answer will be to widen the
  vocabulary rather than to admit a rule, a selector or a path. The three crossings are written
  down so that widening it is a decision with a name on it.
- **The machine store grows a sixth kind of entry**, and ADR 0034's rule is narrower for it: the
  next one has to argue against five precedents instead of four.
- **purlis now has a decision it has not implemented.** That is the point, and the risk is the
  ordinary one for such a record — that the first implementer reads the recommendation and not the
  gate. The gate is numbered so that skipping an item is visible.

## Amendment, 2026-09-22: the sandbox is not a gate, and the consent surface carries what that costs

**The operator ruled on 2026-09-22 to ship the subprocess runtime with no OS sandbox.** He was
shown the honesty paragraph under decision 1 first — that a subprocess runs as his user, with his
filesystem, and can read `.charter/vaults/`, write the machine store and edit `charter.local.toml`
without asking purlis for anything — and chose to ship anyway. His words:

> *"Ship the subprocess runtime as ADR 0041 recommends — for pure plugin system, but in future we
> can control it on level of future marketplace, so some checks can restrict plugins to have bad
> code inside, so un-trusted source plugins just can add some warning in charter — charter can
> announce that you are using plugin from not trusted sources. But this is all for future, now
> clean pure plugin system without sandboxes."*

So: **a subprocess over a unix socket, no OS sandbox, and marketplace vetting with
untrusted-source warnings deferred.** This is not re-litigated, and an implementer who reads this
amendment and builds something narrower has not followed it either.

**This removes no gate item, because the sandbox was never one.** Item 7 asked for the
confinement to be *decided* — "a sandbox, or explicitly not one, in writing" — and this is the
writing. What it removes is a reading this record invited: three paragraphs before the gate it
says *"real confinement is a sandbox … until one exists, a plugin is trusted code that charter is
polite to"*, and a reader could take that as a runtime waiting on one. It is not. The item is met
and the runtime may be built.

**Item 7's conditional half has therefore fired, and is discharged here.** "If not, ADR 0028 is
re-opened in the same PR." It is, in the same change as this amendment: 0028's own record now
carries the note that its re-opening clause has been triggered and what the answer to it is. That
clause exists because 0028 accepts a `stat`-then-open race *only* on the grounds that nothing in
purlis makes an agent less privileged than purlis itself — and the whole proposition of a plugin
boundary is that a plugin is less privileged. 0028's answer, written there, is the same one as
here: with no sandbox, a plugin is **not** less privileged, so the ground 0028 stands on has not
moved. That is a reprieve and not a resolution, and the day a sandbox lands the clause fires for
real.

**What the ruling costs, stated as plainly as the paragraph it overrode.** None of this is new
risk that the ruling created; it is the risk the record already described, now accepted rather
than deferred.

- A plugin can do everything the operator can, and the capability table in decision 2 describes
  **purlis's own conduct** and not a cage. Every "No, at any level" in it is a promise about what
  purlis will not do on a plugin's behalf, and none of them is an obstacle to a plugin doing it
  itself.
- The install-time decision carries the entire weight, which decision 3 already said and which is
  now the *final* answer rather than the interim one.
- The three named sandboxes — Seatbelt, seccomp or Landlock, AppContainer — remain uncosted and
  unbuilt, and each stays a platform-specific piece of work with ADR 0031's refuse-rather-than-
  degrade rule waiting on the other side of it.

**What the deferred answer is, and what it is not.** Marketplace vetting and an untrusted-source
warning are a *label on a supply chain*. A warning tells an operator where something came from; it
does not bound what the thing does once it is running, and no amount of it turns the table in
decision 2 into a cage. Vetting scales with reviewers and purlis has one operator, which is the
same argument the "What was rejected" section already makes against a registry. Both are worth
building and neither is a substitute for the sandbox, so neither is written here as though it
were. When they are built they get their own record and their own honest limits.

**What this obliges the first implementer to do, and it is the part most likely to be skipped.**
Because the table is conduct and not a cage, **the consent surface has to say exactly that.** A
prompt listing *this plugin may: contribute a theme, add one palette command*, while the plugin
can in fact read the operator's vaults, is worse than no prompt — it manufactures confidence
purlis cannot back, and a surface that over-promises is one the operator stops reading and then
trusts anyway. The prompt must say, in purlis's own plain voice, that **a plugin runs with the
operator's own access**, and that what purlis shows is what the plugin **declares** and not what
it is **limited to**. That sentence belongs in the core, beside the trust record, pinned by a
test, and carried to whatever draws it — not composed in the dialog, where it would drift kinder
than the truth one edit at a time.

**What is still unmet.** Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 stand exactly as written. In particular the
tool guard is still one blanket `exit 2` with three of six stages wired to nothing, and nothing in
this ruling touches that: the irony this record opens with is unchanged, and a plugin is still a
second door beside the one being built.

## Amendment, 2026-09-22: the fingerprint is over the plugin's DIRECTORY, not over what it declares

**The gap is in this record's own wording**, which is why the amendment is here rather than in a
code comment. Decision 3 says the fingerprint *"has to be a hash of the executable and of every
file it declares, checked at each launch"*. `crates/purlis-core/src/extension.rs` implemented
exactly that. **So a plugin could add or change an UNDECLARED sibling and the fingerprint said
unchanged** — a `.dylib` beside the program, a script it `source`s, a config it reads. None of
those is declared; none of them was hashed.

purlis#150's author followed the record rather than widening it unasked, which was right.
purlis#152 is where the widening got decided, and the operator ruled on 2026-09-22.

**Why it is not a small thing.** It is harmless while stage 1 has no executor and nothing reads
an undeclared file. It stops being harmless the moment stage 2 starts a program, because a
program loads what it likes — at which point *"approved code" stops meaning what the dialog says
it means*. And the dialog was unusually explicit: *"charter has read this extension's files and
will ask again if any of them change."* An undeclared sibling makes that sentence false, and a
consent surface that over-promises is the failure this record's first amendment is entirely
about, arriving through a second door.

### The ruling

**Hash the plugin's whole directory — contents and the set of paths — with ONE manifest-declared
state directory excluded, which is the only place a plugin may write.**

The reasoning is the constraint the rest of this section is designed against, and it is the same
sentence as the first amendment's, pointed the other way: without the carve-out, any plugin that
keeps a cache or a log beside itself re-prompts the operator at every launch, and **a consent
dialog people click through is worse than no dialog at all.**

**What was rejected, and why, so that re-opening any of it has to argue:**

- **hashing the directory with no exclusions** — correct and unusable. A plugin with a cache
  beside it asks at every launch, and the prompt becomes a reflex;
- **refusing to run a plugin whose directory holds anything undeclared** — strictest, and it
  breaks on `node_modules`, `.git`, `README`, `__pycache__`. It reads to the operator as
  *purlis refuses my plugin over a file I didn't write*, which is a tool telling its owner the
  filesystem is wrong;
- **keeping the declared list and rewording the dialog** — cheapest, and it moves the problem
  onto the reader. The record already knows what that costs: decision 3's own *"treating silence
  as a yes is the one state this record exists to keep out"* is the same instinct, and a sentence
  carefully worded around a hole is the polite version of silence.

### What the carve-out has to satisfy, because a carve-out is where this goes wrong

**A state directory that can hold a `.dylib` or a script the program loads has given the whole
property back.** So the exclusion is narrow by construction and the narrowness is enforced, not
described:

1. **One path segment**, directly inside the plugin's directory, so the hole is visible in a
   directory listing rather than buried at `build/tmp/state`.
2. **Named in the manifest, which is itself hashed**, so the carve-out cannot appear, move or
   widen without the operator being asked again.
3. **Nothing the manifest declares may live inside it** — a theme or a program declared under it
   is refused when the manifest is read, so purlis never opens a byte in there.
4. **purlis refuses to load a plugin whose state directory holds a symlink or a file with an
   executable bit.** Metadata only, nothing read, so a cache of ten thousand files is checked
   without being hashed and without prompting anybody.

**And the limit of (4), which belongs in the record and not in a later apology.** No filesystem
predicate makes a file un-loadable as code: `dlopen` does not need the executable bit on Linux,
and `source` needs it nowhere. What the check closes is the careless case and the conventional
one — a helper binary cached beside a log. What it leaves open is *a program the operator
approved choosing to read its own state as code*, which is the same class as a program that
fetches a string and evaluates it, and which no fingerprint anywhere closes. This record already
refuses to pretend otherwise about the fingerprint; it refuses to pretend here too, and the
consent surface carries the sentence rather than leaving it in a doc comment.

### What a symlink is to the hash, decided rather than left to the walk

**A symlink inside the plugin is hashed as a link and is never followed.** Its own target string
goes into the digest. So re-pointing it asks again, a link out of the tree reads nothing out
there, and a loop cannot hang the walk because nothing is walked *through*.

Refusing links outright was the alternative and is the wrong one for the reason the second
rejected option above is wrong: `node_modules/.bin/` is a tree of them. What this leaves honest
is that the *target* of a link out of the plugin is not fingerprinted — it is not part of the
plugin, the link that names it is, and purlis does not claim about files it was never pointed
at.

### The bound, which the declared list did not need and a directory does

A declared list is bounded by the manifest; a directory is bounded by whatever is on the disk, so
**the walk is attacker-influenced input and gets its own limits**: 4096 entries and 64 MiB per
plugin, each refused with a sentence that says what to do rather than a number on its own.
Directories count as entries, which bounds the depth without a second limit to keep in step.

### The cost, which this record left as an open number

purlis#150's point 6 left this unmeasured and the operator asked for it. Measured on an
M-series machine, release build, warm page cache, mean of five re-hashes
(`what_the_re_hash_costs_at_launch` in `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/tests.rs`, so it can be
re-run rather than believed):

| plugin | re-hash at launch |
| --- | --- |
| 4 files / 16 KiB — a theme plugin as one ships | **0.23 ms** |
| 100 files / 1 MiB | **4.4 ms** |
| 1,000 files / 50 MiB | **125–140 ms** |
| 4,064 files / 63 MiB — at the bound | **222–228 ms** |

On a machine under load the bound case reached **1.3 s**. It runs on `spawn_blocking` and the
window is drawn before it, so what a person feels at the bound is the theme repaint arriving
late, not a launch that waits. **The consequence in this record's own list is therefore now
measured for the fingerprint and still open for the subprocess**: gate item 8 is about starting a
process and nothing here touches it.

### What this changes in the record above

- Decision 3's *"a hash of the executable and of every file it declares"* is amended to **a hash
  of every path below the plugin's directory, contents and names alike, except one
  manifest-declared state directory**. The rest of decision 3 — show what it contributes, ask
  once per human per machine, re-ask when it changes, every unreadable state means ask, and it is
  not a boundary — stands word for word.
- The consequence *"this one reads an executable"* is amended to **this one reads a directory**,
  with the numbers above.
- The first amendment's obligation on the consent surface now has a second clause: the prompt
  says a plugin runs with the operator's own access and that the list is a declaration rather
  than a limit, **and it says which one directory purlis did not read**, when there is one.

### What is still unmet

**Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 stand exactly as written**, and nothing in this amendment closes any
of them. In particular this is not a sandbox, it is not a boundary, and it does not make a
plugin's code safe to run — it makes the fingerprint mean what the dialog already claimed it
meant. The implementation is purlis#152.

## Amendment, 2026-09-23: stage 2 exists — the executor, the gate item by item, and what it is not

**This amendment is not a sign-off and does not claim one.** It records that the runtime this
record gates has been built, in purlis#212 (unmerged when this was written), and
it goes through the gate one item at a time so that whether the gate was honoured is a thing a
reader checks rather than a thing a brief asserts. The operator has not ruled on any of it.

**What was built**, in `diazoxide/charter`:

- `crates/purlis-core/src/executor.rs` — the executor. It starts an approved extension's
  declared program, hands it one question, reads one answer, and stops it.
- `crates/purlis-core/src/handed.rs` — the one file that says what purlis hands a program,
  and the one sentence the consent prompt says about it, held to each other by a test.
- A third word in the manifest vocabulary, **`views`**: a surface the operator opens, filled by
  asking the extension's program. It is this record's second minimum capability — *"a named
  palette command that, when the operator invokes it, sends one request to the plugin and
  displays the text that comes back"* — with *the text* widened to ADR 0043's panel vocabulary,
  and nothing else widened.
- `crates/persona-statistics` — the first consumer, written as a stranger's extension would be:
  it does not link purlis's core, and it knows only the protocol.

### The design, read against decision 1

**A subprocess over a unix socket, as ruled — and the socket is a `socketpair`.** purlis makes
both ends, keeps one, and hands the program the other as its standard input and output. That is
inside the ruling's words and is argued rather than assumed, because it is a choice the record
did not make: decision 1 reached for `hookwire`'s bound socket file and its `0600`/`0700`
guards. An unnamed pair has **no path**, so there is no mode to get right, no directory to
create at the right mode and no bind-then-chmod race — the review-found defect decision 1
cites cannot recur because its subject does not exist — and one extension's program cannot
reach another's channel, because there is no address to reach it at. It also keeps decision 1's
first reason whole: the program reads a line on stdin and prints a line on stdout, so an author
debugs it by pasting a request into a terminal. Windows refuses, as `hookwire`'s Windows arm
already does and for the same reason: no `AF_UNIX` in Rust's standard library there.

**One process per question, not a long-lived plugin host.** The program is started when the
operator opens a view and stopped when it has answered — in its own process group, and the
whole group is killed, so a helper it left running goes with it. The consequence the record
worried about under *"a subprocess is a second process to start, supervise and reap"* is
therefore small: there is nothing to supervise between questions, and the app's `Exit` kills
whatever is mid-answer. The cost is a spawn per question, measured below.

**The gate is re-taken at the press.** The executor re-reads the extension record and
re-fingerprints the extension's **whole directory** (purlis#152's tree hash) at the moment
it is about to start the program, and starts nothing unless the result is *approved, these
bytes, at this path*. A survey taken when the window opened decides which buttons are drawn,
never what runs. This is what makes the consent dialog's sentence — *"charter has read every
file in this extension's directory … and will ask again if any of them changes"* — true at the
only moment it matters.

**A yes given before the executor existed does not cover running.** Until now the prompt said of
a declared program *"this charter has no extension runtime and does not start it"*. An
extension that declares a program now carries the executor's protocol number inside its
fingerprint, so every such approval reads as changed and is asked for again, under the prompt
that says it will run. A theme-only extension is not re-asked; nothing its yes covered moved.

### The gate, item by item

1. **ADR 0031 signed off.** Met, 2026-09-22 (unchanged).
2. **The tool guard is wired.** **Met by purlis#181** (merged 2026-09-22): *"charter answers
   the Bash guard: A7 is ported, the eight arms are one verdict, and the switch flips"* — M3.1
   stage 6, and `charter hook pretooluse` answers from the guard rather than a blanket `exit 2`.
   The paragraph under the previous amendment that says the guard is still one switch was true
   when written and is not now. The irony this record opens with is resolved in the direction it
   asked for: the guard ran before the runtime did.
3. **#112 and #123 closed.** Met — both closed. The executor reuses the fixed path rather than
   copying it: it calls `extension::read_at`, whose reads are the `O_NOFOLLOW`, bounded,
   descriptor-checked reads #112 asked for, and whose fingerprint and declarations are one read,
   which is #123's shape.
4. **A named plugin wants a capability the theme vocabulary cannot express, written down in this
   sequence before the runtime.** The plugin is **persona statistics**, and the want was written
   down first by ADR 0043 (*"statistics … not expressible … the missing piece is a producer"*).
   The capability is written down here: **a view about personas is handed this plane's persona
   names, which one is the default, and the stamp each of their memories was written under —
   never a title and never a body.** That sentence is `handed::what`, the value is
   `handed::personas`, and a test fails if the two stop agreeing. It lands in the same change as
   the runtime rather than a sequence before it, and that is said rather than smoothed over:
   0043 is the earlier record of the want, and this is the record of the grant.
5. **The protocol refuses, per platform, what it cannot express.** Met: on anything that is not
   unix the executor answers a refusal naming ADR 0031 before it reads anything, and the
   extension record itself was already refused there.
6. **Every unreadable state asks, each with a test seen to go red with its guard removed.** The
   executor's gate refuses, with a test for each, for: not installed, installed and not approved,
   the program's bytes changed, an undeclared file added beside it, the directory moved away from
   the approved path, the record unreadable, an approval borrowed from another id naming the same
   directory, the program not executable, a view the manifest does not declare. Where the program
   could have run, a marker it would have written is checked absent. The mutation run that removed
   each guard and watched its test go red is in purlis#212's body.
7. **Confinement decided.** Met, 2026-09-22: explicitly not a sandbox. Unchanged, and see below.
8. **The round trip is measured before the protocol is fixed.** Measured on the operator's
   machine (macOS, Apple silicon), 20 rounds after a warm-up:
   - a `/bin/sh` program that answers at once — the protocol's floor: **gate 0.16 ms, round
     trip 2.9 ms**;
   - the real persona statistics producer, release build (616 KiB): **gate 1.9 ms, round trip
     4.3 ms, 6.7 ms for the whole ask** including the plane read;
   - the same, debug build (2 MiB): gate 77 ms — the tree hash in an unoptimised build, which
     is what a developer iterating on an extension pays and an operator does not.

   Against ADR 0026, the nearest limit a person perceives is *a tab or pane switch within
   100 ms*; a view opens inside a tenth of that. **One cost outside those numbers:** macOS
   assesses a program file the first time it is executed. It was ~200 ms alone and 4.2 s under
   a parallel test run on this machine, and it falls inside the executor's five-second deadline,
   so a first open of a freshly built extension on a loaded machine can time out once. Measured,
   not fixed.

### What it is not, in the record as well as in the code

- **Not a sandbox**, as ruled. The program runs as the operator. It can write anywhere he can —
  outside its state directory included — and the consent prompt says so from the core
  (`RUNS_AS_YOU`, and a state-directory note that now says writes outside the extension's
  directory are not something purlis sees at all).
- **Not proof against a program set on outliving its question.** The process-group kill closes
  the ordinary case. A program that calls `setsid` or double-forks out of its group escapes it,
  because it runs as the operator; what would stop that is the sandbox that was declined.
- **Not atomic with the fingerprint.** The tree is hashed and then the program is started by
  path; a write between the two runs unhashed. That is ADR 0028's accepted race, and its own
  amendment of 2026-09-22 already answered it for this runtime: with no sandbox, a writer who can
  win the race already runs as the operator and needs no race. Closing it would need `fexecve`
  (`unsafe`) or a private copy of the binary per press (a new unseen executable each time, which
  is the macOS assessment above on every click).

### What purlis hands a program, and what it keeps back

The request is one line: the protocol number, the extension and view ids, the subject, the
persona the view was opened from (when it was), and the value `handed.rs` built. The program is
started with **an empty environment plus eight variables a program needs to be a program**
(`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, `TMPDIR`) and three that say
what it is (`PURLIS_EXTENSION`, `PURLIS_PROTOCOL`, and `PURLIS_EXTENSION_STATE` when it has a
state directory) — decision 2's row *"the harness environment: No"*, applied to purlis's own
environment. It is started through `forklock`, so it cannot inherit a chat's half-open terminal
(purlis#53). It is started in the extension's own directory.

### What is still open

- **No second grant exists, and none was invented.** A view cannot put a purlis verb on a row
  (`panel::NO_VERB` refuses it in an answer exactly as in a manifest); it cannot subscribe,
  cannot be pushed to, cannot run on a timer, and is handed nothing but its subject's facts.
  Each of those is a capability a later plugin may want, and this record's rule still applies:
  written down for a plugin that wants it, never ahead of one.
- **Marketplace vetting and untrusted-source warnings** remain deferred, as the previous
  amendment recorded.

## Amended 2026-09-24: a project chooses among what this machine approved

[ADR 0048](0048-a-project-chooses-among-the-extensions-this-machine-approved.md) lets a project's
`charter.toml` and `charter.local.toml` turn an approved extension on or off, and set what it
declares. It does not amend decision 3 or "an extension does not travel in a plane": approval is
still this machine's alone and is checked first, and a project can name only an extension this
machine already has.

## Amended 2026-09-25: capabilities are granted one at a time

[ADR 0053](0053-an-extension-is-granted-capabilities-one-at-a-time.md) adds a `capabilities` list to
the manifest. A word this purlis does not know refuses the whole manifest, by name, and every
capability is named in the approval prompt and covered by the fingerprint. Each capability is
added in its own change, with its own amendment here. Where this record's two amendments of
2026-09-22 and 2026-09-23 disagree about which gate items are met, the 2026-09-23 one supersedes
the earlier, and its item-by-item account of the gate is the current one. Nothing here changes decision 2's
table. No capability can reach the machine store, `reopen.json`, harness profiles or vaults.

## Amended 2026-09-25: an extension can act and write, and purlis reports what it wrote

purlis#341 adds the `palette`, `actions` and `writes` capabilities (ADR 0053's amendment
of the same day). What this changes in the threat model:

- **A second request, from the same gate.** Running an action starts the program the same way a
  view does: the record first, the project's on or off, the fingerprint taken again over the
  whole tree at the press, one process, the deadline and the kill. The operator's press is still
  the only thing that starts it. A palette command is a press too. "One round trip per
  deliberate human action" holds.
- **Asking first is enforced by the core, not the window.** The executor refuses an action that
  asks first (its manifest's `confirm`, or `deletes`) unless the operator said yes.
- **Writes are declared, handed and watched, not confined.** The declared paths are inside the
  fingerprint and named in the prompt. Each request hands them resolved. After each question
  purlis compares what `git status` shows in the plane and reports a change outside them,
  naming the extension. This does not change decision 1: there is still no sandbox, and an
  extension can still write anywhere the operator can. What is new is that the ordinary case
  of writing outside the declared paths is visible, where before it was silent. No declared
  path may cover the files purlis reads settings, grants or vaults from.
- **What is still open:** the report cannot see an ignored path or a plane that is not a git
  repository, and it cannot tell who made a change. An extension that lies about `deletes` is
  reported, not stopped.
## Amended 2026-09-25: a built-in extension is trusted through the app

purlis#339, the first change in [ADR 0053](0053-an-extension-is-granted-capabilities-one-at-a-time.md)'s
build order. Persona statistics now ships inside the app, in the bundle's resources
(`Contents/Resources/extensions/` on macOS, `/usr/lib/charter/extensions/` in a `.deb`, and
`$APPDIR/usr/lib/charter/extensions/` inside an AppImage). It is a **built-in extension**: the registry lists it with `source: app` and treats it as
approved with no prompt. This is a trust decision, so here is its threat model, by class.

**What makes an extension built in is where it is, and only that.** The app finds its resource
directory when it starts and hands it to the core (`extension::BuiltIn`). An extension is built in
when its directory is directly inside that one, and it is approved at that path and no other.
Nothing a file says can make an extension built in:

- **A write to the record.** A row with `"source": "app"` holds one thing, whether the operator
  turned that built-in off on this machine. purlis reads nothing else from it, not a path and not a
  fingerprint. A record row that claims a directory is the app's grants that directory nothing.
- **A copy of a built-in.** The same directory with the same bytes, anywhere outside the running
  app's resources, is an ordinary extension and reads as new. purlis refuses to install an
  extension whose id is a built-in's while the app ships that built-in. One id is one extension, so a
  copy takes its own id. A row the operator installed before the app shipped the extension under
  that id is set aside and said: that is the hand-assembled persona statistics on the day this
  lands.
- **A link.** A built-in's directory has to be a directory, not a link out of the bundle.

**Where the running app is, is Tauri's answer (`resource_dir`), and it is not a boundary either.**
On Linux it is the directory beside the executable (`../lib/charter`), and Tauri falls back to the
`APPDIR` variable for an AppImage. So a person who copies the executable next to a
`lib/charter/extensions` of their own, or who starts the app with `APPDIR` set, chooses its
built-ins. They have also chosen which program runs, or its environment, and either of those
already runs code as the app (`LD_PRELOAD` needs no extension). The same class as the next
paragraph.

**A writer into the app bundle gains nothing it did not have.** Whoever can change
`Contents/Resources` can change `Contents/MacOS/charter-app` too, and replacing the app is strictly
more than replacing one of its extensions. So purlis does not fingerprint a built-in. Any bytes
inside the bundle are trusted, which is also how an update's new version of the extension is
trusted without asking. What covers those bytes is what already covers the app:

- On macOS, the bundle's seal. The extension's program is a resource, and the seal hashes every
  resource, which `codesign --verify --deep --strict` checks in the release workflow. It is sealed
  as a resource, not signed as nested code. Notarization is declined (ADR 0042), so nothing asks for
  more today. A later decision to notarize has to move the program to where nested code goes.
- On Linux, `/usr/lib/charter` is root's in a `.deb`, and an AppImage is one file.
- For an update, the updater's minisign signature is over the `.app.tar.gz` and the AppImage,
  which contain the extension (ADR 0042). A built-in's new bytes arrive only through a verified
  update.

**What built-in trust skips, and what it does not.** It skips the approval prompt and the
fingerprint comparison, and nothing else. The executor still re-reads the directory at every press
and refuses what it cannot read. The manifest is still parsed against this purlis's vocabulary,
and an unknown capability still refuses it. The program still runs one question at a time, with the
same empty environment, deadline and bounds, and is handed only what `handed.rs` hands any
extension. A project or a workspace still turns it off as it turns off any extension (ADR 0048).
Off on this machine, it contributes nothing and the executor starts nothing. It is never removed,
because the app would bring it back at the next read. Windows still refuses (ADR 0031). A record
purlis cannot read leaves every built-in off, since it cannot say whether the operator turned one
off. That record cannot make an installed extension approved either.

**Persona statistics links the core, and that is a first-party decision, not a change to the
contract.** It links `charter_core::personaverbs::stats`, the code `purlis persona stats` counts
with, so the view and the CLI give the same numbers. It reads nothing more than before: purlis
still hands it names, the default, and one date per memory, and linking the core gives it no reach
that `RUNS_AS_YOU` did not already say it had. The date is now the day `memstore.memory_date` finds,
the stamp line's date or a `YYYYMMDD-` file name, where it was the stamp's minute. That hands
less, and it dates a memory as the CLI does. It is the same protocol, so nothing re-asks. The claim
this extension used to carry, that a stranger can meet the contract without linking the core, is now
carried by `extension-probe`, which links nothing of purlis's.

## Amended 2026-09-25: badges and repo columns read a facts file (purlis#340)

The `badges` and `repo-columns` capabilities (ADR 0053) let an extension show values in the
status bar, the terminal footer and the repo table. purlis reads them from `<state>/facts.json`
and never starts the program to draw them, so this adds no process and changes nothing in
decision 2's table. What it adds to the threat model:

- **The facts file is extension-written input on a hot path.** `charter statusline` reads it on
  every turn. It is opened without following links, refused over 64 KiB, and parsed as data;
  each value is bounded and refused if it holds anything that draws as nothing. A bad file
  contributes nothing and says why. It never fails the footer.
- **It fills only what the manifest declared.** The badges and columns are inside the
  manifest's bytes, so they are fingerprinted and named in the approval prompt. A field the
  manifest did not declare contributes nothing and is reported, so a facts file cannot put
  anything on screen that the operator was not asked about.
- **Approval is re-checked before anything is drawn.** The reader takes the executor's gate: the
  record, then the fingerprint over the whole tree. An extension that changed since it was
  approved contributes nothing, and the project and workspace on/off (ADR 0048) is asked as well.
- **What it does not close.** The state directory is outside the fingerprint (purlis#152),
  so the values can change at any time without asking. That is the point: they are data the
  extension reports, not code, and they are drawn as text beside its name.

## Amended 2026-09-25: events, and a quoted section in the session-start briefing (purlis#343)

The `events` and `briefing` capabilities (ADR 0053, protocol 2) are the first that start an
extension's program **without the operator opening anything**: after a core action it hears
about, and when a chat starts. Decision 1 is unchanged — one process per question, the gate
re-taken before each, the same bounds and kill — and decision 2's table is unchanged: neither
capability reaches the machine store, `reopen.json`, harness profiles, vaults or a secret.
What it adds to the threat model:

- **"Never on its own" is no longer true of such an extension, and the prompt says so.** The
  program line of the approval prompt names when purlis starts it — after each event it
  hears, when a chat starts — instead of the view-only sentence, and every event it hears is
  listed. The lists are inside the manifest's bytes, so adding an event re-asks.
- **An event never changes the action it reports.** It is delivered after the action has
  finished, by the surface that did it. **In the app it is off the command's path**: the app
  starts a thread once a command — or auto-save — has its answer, and returns the answer
  without waiting. **The `purlis` binary answers first and then waits**: it prints and flushes
  its answer, with its exit status already decided, and only then asks, before the process
  ends. A shell or a chat waiting for the process to end therefore waits up to one deadline,
  and only when an extension that hears that event is slow — every extension is asked at once
  — which is the cost of keeping the note where the person who ran the command sees it. A
  process detached from the command would cost nothing and could tell nobody that an extension
  missed the event. Each extension is asked on a thread of its own with the normal deadline,
  and an event waits its turn behind a question still in flight rather than being refused. A
  failure or a timeout is one note naming the extension — the status line's extension notes in
  the app, a line on stderr in a terminal — and nothing else.
- **Both are protocol-2 questions like #341's actions.** Each carries `writes`, and purlis
  watches the plane while it is answered; a write outside the declared paths is one more note
  naming the extension. Protocol 2 was unreleased when they were added, so they grew it rather
  than bumping to 3.
- **A chat starting is the one event on a shorter clock.** `session-started` is told inside
  the session start's bounded wait below, beside the briefing question and with its bounds,
  because the hook that reports it is what holds the chat's start: told after it, it would be
  told by a process the harness is still waiting on.
- **A briefing section is extension-written text in front of the model, so it is quoted as
  data.** It sits under a line of purlis's own naming the extension and saying it is data,
  not instructions, and that nothing in it is a task, a permission, a hook or a setting; every
  line of it is set off with `> `. It is cut at 1,500 characters, all sections together at
  6,000, and a section holding anything `panel::undrawable` refuses is left out whole, with a
  line of purlis's own saying it is missing. It cannot add a permission, a hook or a setting
  by construction: it is one string inside `additionalContext`, which purlis serializes
  itself beside its own `hookEventName`.
- **A chat's start is bounded whatever the extensions do.** `charter hook sessionstart` asks
  every extension that briefs or hears the start at once, gives each question 2 seconds and
  the whole of it 3, then kills every program still running and briefs the chat without it. A
  machine with no such extension pays one read of the record, and the briefing is byte for
  byte what it was before.
- **A changed or turned-off extension adds nothing and hears nothing.** The record, the
  project and workspace on/off (ADR 0048) and the fingerprint are asked before anything
  starts; an extension that changed since it was approved is a note for the operator and adds
  not even the missing-section line.
- **A built-in extension (purlis#339) hears and briefs like any other, where purlis knows
  it is one.** The app's executor knows its bundle, so a built-in hears the events the window's
  commands and auto-save report, and one turned off on this machine hears nothing. The
  `purlis` binary passes no bundle — as `charter statusline` does — so a built-in neither
  hears a terminal's commands nor briefs a chat's start. That is deliberate for now: the binary
  cannot tell an app bundle from a folder claiming to be one, and a briefing that trusted a
  path the binary guessed would be trusting a file's word.
- **A fork carries an extension's workspace folder even while it is off.** It is data the
  extension keeps in the plane, and a fork is not the moment to decide it stays behind. The
  folder is one plain name declared in the fingerprinted manifest, never one of purlis's own
  names in a workspace, only for an approved and unchanged extension, and never a clone.
- **What it does not close.** The program still runs as the operator (`RUNS_AS_YOU`). An
  extension that hears events runs more often than one the operator opens, which is more
  chances to do what any program running as the operator can do; the prompt says when, and
  that is the whole of the answer.

## Amended 2026-09-25: commands under the extension's own id (purlis#342)

The `cli` capability (ADR 0053, protocol 2) lets a chat or a script start an extension's program
from a terminal: `purlis <extension id> <command> …`. Decision 1 is unchanged: one process per
command, the gate taken again first, the same deadline and kill. Decision 2's table is unchanged.
What it adds to the threat model:

- **A new caller: whoever can run `purlis`, a chat included.** Until now a person in the window
  started every question, or a core action the person took. A command is started by a command
  line, and a chat can type one. So the tool guard judges it like any `purlis` call. The
  persona tool gate never waves through one that writes. It prompts for any extension command
  unless the installed manifest declares that command `"writes": false`, and that includes a
  command the extension does not declare and an extension that is not installed. It reads the
  manifest, not the approval: a manifest edited to call a writing command a reading one is
  changed, and the executor refuses to run it.
- **The same gate as a view.** The record comes first, then the project's and the workspace's
  on or off, then the fingerprint over the whole tree. An extension that was never approved,
  is turned off, or has changed on disk says so on stderr, exits 1 and runs nothing.
- **What the program prints reaches the caller unchanged.** That includes a chat's context,
  as the output of any program the chat runs does. It is not quoted as data the way a briefing
  section is, because the caller asked for it by name. The output is bounded at 512 KiB for
  each stream. purlis's only addition is its own line on stderr after the program's: a write
  outside the declared paths, or any plane change at all from a command that says it only
  reads.
- **No extension can stand where a core command does.** An extension id that is a core command
  word is refused at every read of the manifest. The `purlis` binary asks its own parser
  before it looks for an extension. A test fails the build for a new core command that the
  refusal does not know.
- **The command line does not reach built-in extensions yet.** It passes no bundle, as it does
  for badges, events and the briefing (#340, #343). It cannot tell the app's bundle from a
  folder claiming to be one, so a built-in's commands would be trusted on a guessed path. No
  built-in declares a command today. A word that is neither purlis's nor an installed
  extension's gets clap's own error, followed by one line saying so. Reaching built-ins needs
  the binary to find the bundle it shipped in, with the same containment the app uses. That is
  its own change.
- **What it does not close.** The program runs as whoever runs `purlis` (`RUNS_AS_YOU`). A
  command that says it only reads and writes anyway is reported, not stopped, as for an action.

## Amended 2026-10-09: the `purlis` binary finds the bundle it shipped in (purlis#1366)

The command line, the footer's badges, the events a command tells and the session-start
briefing now reach the app's built-in extensions. Each passed no bundle before (#340, #342,
#343), because the binary could not tell the app's bundle from a folder claiming to be one.

**Where the bundle is comes from the binary's own real path, and from nothing else.** The
binary resolves its executable through every link, then reads the layout the app ships:

- macOS: `<name>.app/Contents/MacOS/purlis` has its built-ins in
  `<name>.app/Contents/Resources/extensions`.
- Linux: `<usr>/bin/purlis` has them in `<usr>/lib/purlis/extensions`. `<usr>` is `/usr` in
  a `.deb` and the image's own `usr` in a mounted AppImage. `purlis` is the app's product name,
  which is also where Tauri puts the app's resources. The 2026-09-25 amendment's
  `/usr/lib/charter` predates the rename.

No environment variable, setting, record or plane takes part, so nothing a chat can set moves
it. That is stricter than the app's own answer, which on Linux falls back to `APPDIR`. A link
anywhere between the executable's directory and the extensions directory refuses the bundle.
A binary that is not inside one, such as a development build, a test or a copy, reaches no
built-in. Its line after an unknown word says it is outside the app's bundle.

**This is the containment the app already has, not a new one.** A person who copies the binary
next to a folder shaped like a bundle chooses its built-ins. They have also chosen which program
runs, which is the class the 2026-09-25 amendment already accepts for the app. Everything else
built-in trust skips or keeps is unchanged: the executor re-reads at every press, the manifest is
checked, and the operator's "off" holds.

A persona's grant now reads a built-in command's own `"writes": false` too, so such a command
can be waved through. Outside a bundle, a built-in command is not reached at all.
