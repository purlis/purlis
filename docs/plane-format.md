# The plane format

> Moved here from purlis/purlis-plane's `docs/plane-format.md` (at commit `0ae0961d`) by
> [ADR 0044](adr/0044-charter-apps-design-record-lives-in-charter-app.md). The text is unchanged.
> A path it names that is not in this repository — `docs/research/…`, `docs/superpowers/…`,
> `charter/*.py`, an ADR numbered below 0025 — is in
> [purlis/purlis-plane](https://github.com/purlis/purlis-plane/tree/0ae0961d8a6a8e59b48ba43b10d28de8fd87afb7).

A **control plane** is a directory marked by `charter.toml`. This document records what is
inside one: every file and every field the Python `purlis` reads or writes, as it does today
at commit `50d31dc` (0.62.1).

It exists because purlis is being rebuilt as a desktop app on a Rust core (ADR 0025, spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-charter-app.md`, decision 13). **The plane format does not
change.** The app reads *and writes* the plane in Rust from M1, and answers its own hooks: no
shipped path crosses languages, and Python charter is the differential oracle in CI rather than a
dependency of the app (ADR 0025 as amended, spec decisions 14 and 15). Until Python charter is
retired at M4 both implementations still work on the *same plane at the same time* — the CLI, the
hooks a plane is already wired with and a running tmux frame are Python — so a file one of them
writes is a file the other one may be reading a moment later.

This document is the contract between them. It is descriptive, not aspirational: where the code
and the prose docs disagree, the code is recorded here and the disagreement is named.

## How to read it

Every file is marked **stable** or **internal**.

- **stable** — the rebuild must read it, and write it, exactly as recorded here. A file is
  stable when any of these is true: the operator edits it by hand; it is committed to the
  plane's git and so travels to other machines and people; a process other than the one that
  wrote it reads it; or a harness (Claude Code, opencode, Codex) reads it.
- **internal** — implementation state: written and read by one module as a cache, lock or
  marker, safe to delete, rebuilt on demand. The rebuild may change these, and each entry says
  what deleting it costs.

Marking is deliberately generous. Anything purlis writes that another process reads is stable,
because during the migration those two processes are Python charter and the app.

Every claim cites the code that makes it true, as `charter/<module>.py:<line>` at `50d31dc`.
Citations are checked mechanically; if you move code, re-run the check (below).

Four calls were close enough to be worth stating outright:

- **`.charter/frame/**` is the tmux frame's.** The app replaces that frame rather than
  reading its state, so it neither reads nor writes there. The ruling is spelled out at
  [`frame/`](#frame--the-tmux-frames-own-state-chats-panels-reopen), and ADR 0032 records
  what it costs the one ladder that reads a file there — the workspace resolution order.
- **A cache a second process reads is still internal** when deleting it costs only
  recomputation — `cache/harness-wiring.json`, `cache/repostate.json`, `cache/glstate.json`.
  Each entry says what deleting it costs, which is the thing a rebuild actually needs.
- **`.charter-generated` is stable.** Deleting it does not degrade gracefully: every file
  it vouches for is then read as the operator's own and never refreshed again.
- **`.charter/harness-profiles-launched.json` is stable**, though it lives in the state
  directory: it records an operator's consent to run a command, and a second process reads
  it to decide whether to ask again (ADR 0022).

Field tables use: **Required** (must be present), **Optional** (a default applies, given in the
row), and the status of that field where it differs from its file's.

### Every store has a tier

Every file below also carries a **Tier:** line, which says where it lives and so what a backup,
a second machine and a deletion do to it
([ADR 0069](adr/0069-every-store-charter-writes-is-in-one-of-four-tiers.md)):

- **Plane** — committed to the plane's git. The remote is its backup, and it travels to every
  clone.
- **Clone state** — per clone, in the plane directory but never committed: `.charter/`,
  `charter.local.toml`, a LOCAL workspace's files. Not derived from anything, so FR-10's backup
  carries it.
- **Machine** — outside every plane: the machine store (ADR 0034's directory,
  `$PURLIS_CONFIG_HOME`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, else `~/.config`, then `purlis/` once
  rename-local has moved it, else `charter/`), purlis's data home (`<data>`:
  `$PURLIS_DATA_HOME`, else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/` then `purlis/` once rename-local has moved it,
  else `charter/`, else the same under the OS data directory; ADR 0075,
  `crates/purlis-core/src/datahome.rs`), the app's OS
  directories, and the lines purlis writes into a harness's global config. Each one is
  **syncable** (a preference of the operator's that could follow them to another machine) or
  **device-bound** (true of this machine only: an absolute path, a consent, an identity).
- **Keyring** — the operating system's credential store. It holds secret values, and nothing
  else holds them except a plain-file vault. FR-10 never copies it.
- **None** — a path this document records that is not purlis's store: the operator's
  checkout, a harness's own file, a vendor's output.

A workspace's files are in two tiers at once, and say so: **Plane when LIVE, Clone state when
LOCAL**. The same path is committed while the workspace is LIVE and stays in this clone while
it is LOCAL, so a backup reads the LIVE block to know which.

After the tier come the marks that apply: **rebuildable** (derived: deleting it costs a rebuild
and nothing else, and a backup skips it), **transient** (it lives for a session, a turn or one
operation, and a backup skips it) and **legacy** (only the retired Python charter creates it,
and purlis at most keeps it consistent). Clone state or Machine with none of the three
marks is what FR-10 backs up.

**The per-session stores and the dispatch records are collected** (SC-7, #1452, #1004). When the app opens a plane that is not already
open in it, `purlis_core::retention::on_open` removes, from that plane's own `.charter/` only
(`<plane>/.charter/…`, never a `$CHARTER_HOME` that several planes may share). The sweep runs
outside the app's lock on its open projects (#1027), so a long one holds up only the open of
its own plane:

- a `.charter/sessions/<sid>.<ending>` marker last written 30 days or more before
  (`retention::KEEP_FOR`) — every ending but `.tools` and `.gate`, which go sooner (below);
- a `.charter/persona-state/trace/<session>.jsonl` trace last appended to 30 days or more
  before, **unless it records a secret handed out** (`secret-exec`, `secret-reveal`,
  `secret-cp`, `identity-move`: `secrets::cmd::HANDED_OUT`). Such a trace is kept until AU-5
  writes those events into the audit chain, and after that it follows the 30-day rule (V71);
- a `.charter/reports/<id>.json` draft the Python charter left, last written 30 days or more
  before.
- a dispatch record, `.charter/app/dispatches/<id>.json`, whose dispatch ended 30 days or more
  before, as the record says (#1556: a later write, such as forgetting what its chats said, does
  not keep it longer), or, where it has not ended, its end does not read as a time, or it
  still owes its asking chat a report (`undelivered`, marked when the report reached no chat,
  which can be long after the end), last written 30 days or more before; unless the chat that
  asked or the chat that worked is one the reopen record will bring back (#1452). The chat is
  matched by its id, never by its number where the record has an id: a number is dealt again in another launch, and a chat that only shares one keeps nothing. It
  holds a brief, a report and what the two chats said to each other (#1495), so it is kept as
  session data is and no longer. **What the two chats said goes sooner than the record
  where the record lives on**: 30 days after the dispatch ended, whichever chat is still
  brought back (`dispatchrecord::expire_talk`, below). A write of a
  record that was cut short leaves its temporary file beside it
  (`.purlis-generated.<id>.json.<pid>.<tag>.tmp`), holding the same brief; it is collected by
  the same rule, and no other temporary file is.
- what a chat's harness said its session cost, `.charter/app/spend/<chat>.json`, last written
  30 days or more before, unless the chat, by its id, is one the reopen record will bring back
  (#1457).
- a commit gate cooldown, `.charter/commit-gate/<sid>`, and a first-edit nudge marker,
  `.charter/ws-edit-nudge/<sid>-<ws>`, last written 30 days or more before, unless its session
  is one the reopen record will bring back (for a nudge marker, any returning session its name
  begins with, then `-`). Losing one costs a returning session one more question or one more
  reminder, never its work (#1004).
- a saved-record line a chat in a workspace left for a `Stop` that never ran,
  `workspaces/<ws>/.charter/sessions/<chat>.saved`, last written 30 days or more before, unless
  the chat is one the reopen record will bring back. The plane root's are markers in
  `.charter/sessions/`, above (#1004).
- a session's ephemeral memory, `.charter/persona-state/ephemeral/<session>/`, removed whole once
  the session's folder, each persona folder in it and each file in those was last written 30
  days or more before, unless the session is one the reopen record will bring back. A session
  folder that holds anything but `<persona>/<file>` (a link, a deeper folder, a name purlis never
  makes, a name that is not UTF-8, something it cannot read) is kept whole. A file is removed
  only while it is the one judged, and a folder only once it is empty (#1004).

`.charter/chat-turns/` has no rule: purlis neither writes nor reads it, so nothing there grows.

It keeps the files of every chat the plane's reopen record (`.charter/app/reopen.json`) will
bring back, however old: those keyed on the chat's number or on the conversation it resumes.
With no record at all, it sweeps by age alone. If the record is there but does not parse, is
of another version, cannot be read, or was written before chats kept their numbers, it keeps
every file of every store above and collects only the report drafts. It removes only plain files
whose name is one purlis writes, and the ephemeral memory folders those files emptied. It opens each directory from the plane without following a
link, and ages, reads and removes every file through that handle. It never touches anything
else in `.charter/`: the hook spool and every other file under `app/`, the event log, `terminals/`
(collected by `workspace use`, below) and the rest are not its business. The age is the file's
modification time, so a file a chat still writes stays.

What it cannot see is outside that guarantee:
- A chat started outside the app (a harness in a terminal) is in no reopen record. If it
  resumes after 30 days without writing, its pointers are already gone.
- A chat brought back later with Resume from a record, rather than reopened at this launch, is
  in the same position.
- A `.charter/` copied or synced from another device carries that device's ages and chats.

**`purlis workspace use` collects too** (`retention::on_select`, #1025), through the same held
directories, each time it writes a pointer:
- the markers in `.charter/sessions/` by the rule above: one last written 30 days or more
  before goes, but a `.tools` or `.gate` and the markers of a chat the reopen record will bring
  back (its `<n>.workspace` and `<n>.lock` too). Where the record cannot say which chats come
  back, every marker is kept.
- the per-pane pointers, `.charter/terminals/<tid>.<ending>`, by their age alone: one last
  written 30 days or more before goes. A pane is in no reopen record.

A tier line is `**Tier:** <tier>[, <mark>…]`, optionally followed by ` — ` and a reason. The tier
and marks carry no punctuation of their own: a line with no reason has no full stop. A new
store lands in this document with its tier, under its own heading or as a row of a table whose
first column is `Path`.
`crates/purlis-core/tests/every_store_the_plane_format_names_has_a_tier.rs` fails until it
has one, and it fails on any new heading in the file sections that has no tier and is not
listed in the test as something other than a store. It does not see a store named only in the
prose under another heading, which is why every store gets a heading or a row.

## Fixture planes

The spec asks for fixture planes both implementations test against. They live in the
`purlis` repo, at `tests/fixtures/planes/`, and they were **generated by running this
purlis** — never hand-written — so they are true by construction. The generator that ran it
was retired with the Python oracle (purlis ADR 0046) and the planes are data now. Their
README records what the generator pinned (clock, hostname, user, session id, `PATH`) to keep a
regeneration byte-identical, and what a committed fixture cannot carry (every `.git` directory, the caches keyed by absolute
path, `fingerprint.key`, and the empty directories a fresh plane has — `inventory/` and
`workspaces/` — which are recorded beside each plane instead).

There are two: `minimal`, what `purlis init` leaves behind, and `daily`, a plane in use — a
LIVE workspace with a clone, memory, todos and a snapshot; a second workspace left local; a
second persona with its own and shared memory; a vault registry; and the session state a
harness run leaves in `.charter/`. A file documented here that no fixture holds is one no
offline command writes; the entry for it says which writer to call instead.

One practical note for an agent working with them: purlis's guard denies tool calls that
read a `.charter/vaults/` path, and it cannot know that a fixture vault holds only the
literal `fixture-not-a-secret`. Expect the denial, and do not work around it.

### Checking the citations

`tests/test_the_plane_format_spec_cites_lines_that_exist.py` walks every citation in this
document and fails if the file is gone, the line is past the end of it, or the line is blank —
the three ways a line number rots when code moves under it. It is a pointer check, not a truth
check: it cannot tell whether the cited line still says what this document claims. If it goes
red, re-derive the numbers rather than editing them by hand.

### Compatibility across purlis versions (FR-24)

A team shares one project through git, and each person upgrades purlis on their own schedule.
So two purlis versions read the same files, and this section is the rule they follow (X31, as
amended by V5, and ruled by V37 and D-FR24). It is written before the code that holds it (V5).

**Settled by X31 and V5:**

- **An additive change keeps `schema`.** A new optional key, file or section that an older
  purlis can ignore safely does not bump anything.
- **A reader keeps what it does not know.** A purlis that rewrites a file keeps every key,
  section and line it does not understand, in place. `charter.toml` is edited as text, one key
  at a time ([`charter.toml`](#chartertoml), *Encoding details*), and `workspace.json` is
  rewritten from the whole document purlis read, unknown keys included.
- **A change an older purlis must not ignore is a required feature**, named in `charter.toml`'s
  top-level `requires` list. A purlis that lacks any feature the project requires **opens it
  read-only**: it reads, writes nothing to it, and names the purlis version that has the
  feature.
- **Each sub-format carries its own version**, as `workspaces/<ws>/.charter-structure` and the
  hook registry's `schema` already do, and none is compared with another (see the note on
  `instance.SCHEMA` and `workspace.STRUCTURE_VERSION` at the end of this document).
- **A bump of `schema` or of a sub-format's version needs an ADR, a migration (FR-9) and a
  `doctor` row**, and is staged and announced, so that one person's migration never locks the
  rest of the team out (V5).

**Settled by V37 and D-FR24:**

- **`requires` takes effect together with `schema = 2`** (V37a), as git's `extensions.*` do
  under `repositoryformatversion = 1`. A project that lists `requires` declares `schema = 2`, so
  that a purlis older than FR-24, which does not know `requires`, refuses the project for its
  schema instead of writing it. A purlis that knows `requires` reads it at any `schema`.
- **A `schema` this purlis does not understand makes the project read-only everywhere** (V37a),
  not only for forge commands. This purlis understands 2. A new project is still written with
  `schema = 1`, because it requires nothing.
- **An entry is `{ feature, since }`** (V37b), a public format commitment:

  ```toml
  schema = 2
  requires = [
    { feature = "memory-proposals", since = "0.9.0" },
  ]
  ```

  `feature` names the feature. `since` is the first purlis version that has it, and it is
  what a purlis that lacks it names in its refusal. Without `since`, the refusal says a newer
  purlis has it.
- **Old forms are read for six months from the first release that writes the new form** (V37c).
  After a bump of `schema` or of a sub-format's version, purlis keeps reading the previous
  version for six months. The plane → project rename's old names (#762, ADR 0072) are read for
  the same six months.
- **A file with a closed key set keeps it closed, and gets its own sub-format version**
  (D-FR24). A change record (`workspaces/<ws>/changes/<slug>.json`, ADR 0060) refuses a key it
  does not know rather than drop it. The first change that adds a key to it also gives change
  records a version of their own (absent means 1), so that a purlis that does not know the new
  version locks out only change records, not the whole project.

**Failing closed.** A `charter.toml` that cannot be read or is not TOML, a `schema` that is not
an integer or is higher than 2, a `requires` that is not a list, and an entry with no readable
`feature` each make the project read-only, with a reason that says which. A purlis that guessed
would write a project it does not understand. A directory with no `charter.toml` is not a
project and says nothing.

**Read-only means the committed project files.** Clone state and machine stores belong to this
clone and this machine, and are still written.

**What purlis does with a read-only project today:**

- **The commands that only read still run**, after one line on stderr saying the project is
  read-only and why: `status`, `recall`, `statusline`, `workspace list`, `workspace current`,
  `workspace recall`, `persona list`, `change list`, `session list`, `harness list` and
  `guard list` (or bare `guard`). Each is on the list because a test runs it on a read-only
  project and finds every file unchanged. `doctor` (without `--fix`), `update`, `version`,
  `news`, `root` and the commands that need no project run as they always do. The list is
  explicit: a command that is not on it is refused, so a new command is refused on a read-only
  project until it is shown to only read.
- **Every other command is refused**, each refusal naming the reason: extension commands and the
  core-owned aliases onto them (the same test `extension::cli::extension_command` gives the tool
  guard), `doctor --fix`, `init` and `reinit`.
- **`init` and `reinit` facing a `charter.toml` that is a link out of the project, or into its
  `.git`, write nothing**, and say where the link leads. A link that stays inside the project is
  read through like the file it points at, so its `requires` and `schema` count.
- `purlis doctor`'s `schema` row fails with the same reason and its remedy.
- **The window, and the hooks a chat runs, follow in #826, and no release carries this rule
  without them.** Until #826 lands they do not check `requires` or `schema`.

**The features this purlis knows** (`compat::KNOWN`); any other `requires` entry makes a project
read-only to it:

- **`purlis-names`** (RN-7, V93g). The project's committed files use purlis's names: the manifest
  is `purlis.toml`, and the managed blocks, the generated agents' marker, a committed
  `workspace.json`'s digest key and `.claude/settings.json`'s harness variable are spelt
  `purlis`. Hook commands keep `charter` for the rename's window. `purlis doctor --fix rename-plane` adds it, in the one commit that renames
  those files; nothing else does. A purlis without the feature opens the project read-only and
  says which version has it, so it never writes charter's names beside purlis's.

Read by `crates/purlis-core/src/compat.rs` (`read`, `SCHEMA`), and checked by the `purlis`
command before it runs a command that could write (`crates/purlis-cli/src/main.rs`) and by
`purlis doctor`'s `schema` row (`crates/purlis-core/src/doctor/config.rs`).

## `/etc/purlis/policy.json` — an administrator's policy (this machine, not the plane)

Not a plane file: no project carries it and no chat writes it (#1343, #1423; ADR 0067 §1 and §4
as amended, C9). An administrator puts it on a machine to lock what every project's sandbox, and
everyone working in it, may widen, and to require the sandbox in every project. The strictest
value wins over the project's committed settings, your own and a persona's, and every value it
locks shows "Locked by policy" in Settings with who set it, and offers no control to widen it.
A host it locks out is refused as it is written, by Settings' Add and by Edit as TOML alike; one
a file already held is kept and reaches nothing (#1431). What a person granted before the policy
came, and it now locks out, is listed in Settings › Sandbox › Granted as not in force, with
Revoke. It is read by `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox/policy.rs` (`Locks::of`).

```json
{
  "owner": "Platform team <platform@example.com>",
  "sandbox": {
    "presets": ["model-providers", "forge"],
    "hosts": ["*.corp.example.com", "api.example.com"],
    "personal-hosts": false,
    "persona-hosts": false,
    "opt-out": false,
    "write-grants": false,
    "vault-grants": false,
    "live-asks": false,
    "allow-scopes": ["you"],
    "never-hosts": ["*.paste.example"]
  },
  "dispatch": {
    "running-per-chat": 4,
    "depth": 2,
    "may-run-at-once": 3,
    "allow": false,
    "locked": [{ "from": "steward", "to": "devops" }]
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Locks |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | string | nothing; who set the policy, as Settings and a block's Notice name them (absent: "this machine's administrator") |
| `sandbox.presets` | list of preset words | the Internet access presets a project may turn on; any other is off |
| `sandbox.hosts` | list of hosts | the hosts the project (its own and its `[[forge]]` blocks'), you, a persona or a block's Allow may add (`*.domain` covers every name under it; no port covers every port); any other is not reached. A preset's fixed list is `presets`' to lock |
| `sandbox.personal-hosts` | bool | `false`: your own hosts, and a block's Allow for one chat or for you, reach no chat |
| `sandbox.persona-hosts` | bool | `false`: a persona's own hosts reach no chat |
| `sandbox.opt-out` | bool | `false`: forbids a person's opt-out, and so **requires the sandbox** in every project on this machine. No chat starts without the sandbox from the new-chat picker or a block's Notice. A project with no `[sandbox]`, or one that has not turned it on, runs every chat sandboxed here as if it had, with the default presets (what its `[sandbox]` says applies, and `presets` and `hosts` hold it as they hold any project). Settings shows the mode as "On, required by policy" with who set it, and no control. On a system purlis has no sandbox backend for, no harness chat starts: the refusal names the policy and who set it |
| `sandbox.write-grants` | bool | `false`: no folder is granted to a chat, from a block's Allow or Settings |
| `sandbox.vault-grants` | bool | `false`: no persona's chats use a vault the vault registry does not tag for that persona. A refused vault's Notice offers no Allow, and one already allowed on this machine opens nothing while the lock stands (#1430) |
| `sandbox.live-asks` | bool | `false`: a chat's connection to a host nothing lists is refused at once, as before purlis asked while it waited (#1666); its Notice says policy turned asking off, and an Allow reaches the chat once it restarts |
| `sandbox.allow-scopes` | list of `chat`, `you`, `project` | the scopes a block's Allow may keep a host or folder at (#1666); any other is removed from every Notice and refused, and the Notice says policy removed it. What was kept before stays, judged by the other locks. Any other word refuses the whole file |
| `sandbox.never-hosts` | list of hosts | hosts no level may add and no Allow may keep, written as `hosts` is (#1666): a chat's connection to one is refused and never asked about, and a project's own host it covers reaches no chat. A preset's fixed list is still `presets`' to lock |
| `dispatch.running-per-chat`, `dispatch.live-per-lineage`, `dispatch.depth`, `dispatch.messages-per-minute`, `dispatch.may-dispatch`, `dispatch.may-run-at-once`, `dispatch.tokens-per-session`, `dispatch.minutes-per-task` | whole number, 0 or more (`depth` at most 8); `tokens-per-session` 1 to 1,000,000,000 and `minutes-per-task` 1 to 10,000 | a **ceiling** on that dispatch limit (#1440, #1512): whatever the project, a workspace, a persona or you set, no more is in force, and where none of them sets `tokens-per-session` or `minutes-per-task` the ceiling is the limit (`tokens-per-session` is shown and not enforced yet). `may-dispatch` and `may-run-at-once` cap every persona. `0` switches dispatch off on this machine, and no project, workspace or persona setting turns it back on; `messages-per-minute` at `0` stops messages only; a `0` of the two that are off until set refuses the file. Settings › Project › Dispatch shows each as a policy lock. **A file that is refused switches dispatch off**, and a chat and Settings are told the file is refused, never that a limit was set to `0`; it sets neither of the two off until set, so no task is stopped for it |
| `dispatch.allow` | bool | `false`: no chat dispatches to another (#1437), its own persona included. The refusal and the Notice on the asking chat's tab say the policy's sentence and who set it |
| `dispatch.locked` | list of `{"from": persona, "to": persona}` | each pair no chat may dispatch across: chats running as `from`, to `to`. A pair naming one persona twice stops that persona's chats dispatching to their own persona. No dispatch grant covers a locked pair, one already made included (Settings lists it locked), and its Notice offers no Allow. Anything in the list that is not exactly those two persona names refuses the whole file |

Absent keys and `true` lock nothing. **It is read only when no one but an administrator could
have written it**: a regular file, never a link, owned by root, in a folder owned by root, and
neither writable by anyone else by its permission bits; every chat is denied writing its folder.
A file that is there and fails that (or a folder that is there and fails it, file or no file),
does not parse, or says anything this version does not know is refused, and then every lock but
the presets is set, the required sandbox among them, so purlis never reads a policy it cannot
trust as no policy. No other layer of C9 (an MDM profile, a Windows policy key, an
organisation's policy) is read yet, so no policy is read on Windows.

**Access-control lists are not read.** On Linux an ACL that grants write shows in the
permission bits (the group bits are its mask) and is refused. On macOS an ACL is kept apart from
the bits, so a policy file or folder whose ACL lets someone else write passes this check. Only
root can set one there: `ls -le /etc/purlis` shows it, and `chmod -N` removes it. The folders
above `/etc/purlis` are not checked either; they are root's on a stock system, as for `sudoers`.

## Finding the plane, and the plane root

Covered here: `charter.toml`, `charter.local.toml`, `.charter/harness-profiles-launched.json`,
`harnesses/<name>.toml` and `.charter/harness-declarations-approved.json`,
plane-root discovery, `.gitignore`, the baseline directories, the `purlis init` front-door
scaffold, `inventory/repos.json`, `docs/topology.md`, and the generated README roster block.

---

### Plane-root discovery (no file of its own, but the rule every file below hangs off)

- **Marker:** `charter.toml` at the directory — `is_file`, never a directory
  (`charter/root.py:17`, `charter/root.py:62`). **Status: stable** — it is the one thing a
  second implementation must agree on to find the same plane.
  **Rename window (#1253, RN-1):** `purlis.toml` marks a plane too, and when a directory
  holds both it is the manifest (V93e). `charter.local.toml` and `.charter-scan-allow.toml`
  follow the same rule, and a write goes to the file the plane already has, so a plane with
  only old names is written as before. The state folder is `.purlis/` only when it is the one
  there, or when both are there and this machine's rename-local record says the project moved;
  otherwise it is `.charter/` (RN-2a). A name held under both spellings is named by the doctor's
  `renamed leftovers` row: `rename-plane` reconciles the committed files; `rename-local` moves
  `.charter/` and `charter.local.toml` only where the purlis name is not there yet, and never
  merges two. Every name the rename moves, with its old spellings, is in `crates/purlis-core/src/names.rs`.
- **Resolution order** (`charter/root.py:32`, `find_root`):
  1. `$CHARTER_ROOT` wins outright; it is `expanduser`'d and `resolve`'d, and a value with no
     `charter.toml` under it **raises** rather than falling back to the walk
     (`charter/root.py:49`, `charter/root.py:56`).
  2. Otherwise walk up from `start` (default cwd, resolved) through `(cur, *cur.parents)`
     (`charter/root.py:60`).
  3. A found marker is redirected to the **main working tree** when the directory is a linked
     git worktree whose main tree also carries the marker (`charter/root.py:310` `_plane_of`,
     `charter/root.py:157` `main_worktree_of` — pure path arithmetic on the `.git` file's
     `gitdir:` line, no subprocess).
  4. Then hop **outward** through any enclosing plane's `workspaces/` until the answer stops
     moving (`charter/root.py:91` `_outermost`, `charter/root.py:333` `enclosing_plane`: the
     enclosing marker only counts when `here.relative_to(parent/"workspaces")` succeeds,
     `charter/root.py:363`).
  5. If no marker at all: if the cwd (or an ancestor) is a linked worktree, retry from its
     main tree and that tree's parents (`charter/root.py:79`).
  6. Still nothing → `ControlPlaneNotFound` (`charter/root.py:88`); `find_root_or_cwd`
     swallows that and returns the start directory instead (`charter/root.py:370`), which is
     what makes `purlis --version` and `purlis init` work outside a plane.
- `config` bootstraps from this at **import** of any command
  (`charter/config.py:918`), and `config.use(root)` re-points the whole module
  (`charter/config.py:844`). `purlis init` calls `use()` the moment it writes the marker
  (`charter/commands.py:2718` then `config.use(root)`).
- **Env vars purlis honours here:** `CHARTER_ROOT` (`charter/root.py:20`), `CHARTER_HOME`
  (the state dir, `charter/config.py:42`), `CHARTER_WORKTREES` (`charter/config.py:82`).
- `NESTED_ORIGIN` records the nested plane the caller stands in when the hop fired
  (`charter/config.py:697`, `charter/root.py:131`).
- `.charter-generated` / `.charter-structure` are **workspace-interior** markers written by
  `charter/workspace.py:1935` and `charter/workspace.py:4477`, not plane-root ones — they
  belong to the workspaces area.

Paths derived from the root (all in `derive`, `charter/config.py:661`) that land in this area:
`ROOT` (`:680`), `HAS_CONTROL_PLANE` (`:684`), `SHARED_VAULTS = root/"vaults.json"` (`:774`),
`WORKSPACES_DIR` (`:780`), `INVENTORY = root/"inventory"/"repos.json"` (`:783`),
`DOCS_DIR = root/"docs"` (`:786`), `PERSONAS_DIR` (`:819`), `STATE_DIR` (`:791`).

---

### `charter.toml`

- **Format:** TOML (parsed with stdlib `tomllib`, `charter/instance.py:122`). Hand-maintained;
  purlis only ever edits two keys, as raw text.
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, hand-edited, and read by every purlis process, every
  hook process, and the frame's panel processes.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed; it travels with every clone.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:1066` `_render_charter_toml` (via `cmd_init`,
  `charter/commands.py:2718`) for a fresh plane; thereafter only
  `charter/instance.py:389` `_set_key` — a **line-span textual edit** used by
  `set_locked_version` (`charter/instance.py:325`), `set_default_persona`
  (`charter/instance.py:331`), `declare_default_persona` (`:342`) and
  `clear_default_persona` (`:355`). `purlis version bump` also commits it
  (`charter/commands.py:3842`).
  **In purlis, also the Settings tab's Project level** (`purlis_core::settings::save`,
  purlis#252, SE-17, SE-19): a setting's change, or the whole text from its Edit as TOML
  link, written whole or not at all (a temp file beside it, then one
  rename), keeping the existing file's mode. A form's change is applied with `toml_edit`, so
  every comment, blank line, key order and spacing it did not touch is kept, and a replaced
  value keeps the decoration it had. It refuses to write text that does not parse as TOML, and
  text in which the next read would refuse something the file on disk does not already have — a finding of `purlis doctor`'s
  `charter.toml` row, a `[harness.<name>]` table — in those readers' own words; it refuses a
  value `secretshape` calls a credential whether or not the file already held it; and it
  refuses to write over a file that changed on disk since the tab read it. (The file marks the
  plane, so the tab is only ever open where it exists; were it deleted under the tab, a save
  would create it at 0600.)
  **And `[project].id`**, minted once into a project that has none, with `toml_edit`
  (`planefile::ensure_project_id`, V76; see its row below).
- **Read by:** `charter/instance.py:105` `load` — and *only* there:
  `charter/config.py:719` (every command/hook, at import), plus direct re-reads in
  `charter/commands.py:211`, `charter/commands.py:3614`, `charter/hooks.py:7260`,
  `charter/statusline.py:2123`, `charter/statusline.py:2141`, `charter/doctor.py:343`,
  `charter/persona.py:1031`, `charter/profiles.py:432`, `charter/forge/registry.py:96`,
  `charter/forge/registry.py:140`, `charter/commands_update.py:604`. In purlis, its
  `[extensions]` table is read by `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs`
  (`Choices::read`) for the Settings tab, the window's filter on extension panels,
  views and themes, and the executor's gate (purlis#253); its `[theme]` table by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` (`Said::read`) for the Settings
  tab and the window's theme (purlis#273). Its `[harness_plugins]` table is
  read by `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` (`Choices::read`) for the Settings
  tab and for every chat `start::ready` launches (purlis#274). Its `[sandbox]` table is read
  by `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` (`Said::read`) for every chat `start::ready` launches
  and for the Settings tab's save (ADR 0067).
- **Git:** committed (nothing ignores it; `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE` ignores its *local* sibling
  only, `charter/commands.py:1104`).
- **Encoding details for a byte-identical writer:**
  - `init` renders exactly: `schema = 1`, blank, `[[forge]]`, `kind = "<kind>"`, optional
    `owner = "..."`, optional `host = "..."`, blank, `[memory]`, `share = "local"`, trailing
    newline (`charter/commands.py:1066`–`charter/commands.py:1078`). String values go through
    `json.dumps` (`charter/commands.py:1058` `_toml_str`) — JSON escaping is used as a
    faithful subset of TOML basic-string escaping.
  - `_set_key` (`charter/instance.py:389`) reads with `splitlines(keepends=True)` and writes
    with `p.write_text("".join(lines))` (`charter/instance.py:441`) — **not** atomic, no temp
    file, no lock, comments and formatting preserved. **In purlis** (#357) the same text
    edit is written whole or not at all: a temp file beside `charter.toml`, flushed, then one
    rename, keeping the file's mode and refusing a read-only file. The read, the edit and the
    rename happen under an advisory `flock` on the plane root directory
    (`crates/purlis-core/src/rewrite.rs`), which the settings tab's save takes too, so two
    writers at once both land.
    - Section located by `^[ \t]*\[<section>\][ \t]*$`; the edit is confined to that section's
      span, ending at the next line matching `^[ \t]*\[` (`charter/instance.py:416`,
      `charter/instance.py:426`).
    - Existing key: only the value is replaced, the `key<spaces>=<spaces>` prefix is kept
      (`charter/instance.py:441`).
    - Key absent, section present: inserted as the **first line after the header**,
      `key = "value"\n` (`charter/instance.py:438`).
    - Section absent: appended as `"\n", "[<section>]\n", 'key = "value"\n'` after a newline
      fixup if the file did not end in one (`charter/instance.py:424`).
    - Removal (`value=None`) deletes the key line and **leaves the emptied section header**
      (`charter/instance.py:436`); a missing section or missing key rewrites nothing.
    - Values are always emitted double-quoted, so only string-valued keys are writable this
      way.
    - **In purlis** the edited text is parsed before it is written, and must say what was
      asked (`[section] key` set to the value, or gone for a removal). The edit finds a section
      only by a plain `[section]` header, so a table written any other way (a header with a
      comment, an inline table, a dotted key), or a `section` that is not a table, would be
      doubled or shadowed: that is refused, and the file is left as it was (FD-26). Measured: `set_locked_version` on the `init` output appends
      `\n[charter]\nversion = "0.62.1"\n`.
- **Schema/refusal:** `plane_version` (`charter/instance.py:79`) — absent `schema` means
  `UNSTAMPED = 1` (`charter/instance.py:63`), a non-`int` (or `bool`) value means "cannot
  place" → `PlaneFormatUnknown`; `found > SCHEMA` → `SchemaTooNew`
  (`charter/instance.py:133`). `config.derive` records it as `PLANE_REFUSAL`
  (`charter/config.py:723`) and `cli` declines every command except
  `doctor`/`update`/`version`/`_version-check` (`charter/cli.py:2224` `_DESPITE_REFUSAL`,
  `charter/cli.py:2239`). Malformed TOML instead raises `ValueError`, is caught, and becomes
  `CONFIG_ERROR` with empty defaults (`charter/config.py:725`, `charter/doctor.py:323`).
- **General rule for every `[section]` below:** an absent or wrong-typed section/value
  **degrades to the shipped default** and never raises — `charter.toml` is on the import path
  of `purlis --version` (`charter/instance.py:1994`, `:2955`, `:3039`). The two exceptions
  that *report* rather than swallow are `[harness] default` (`refused`,
  `charter/instance.py:3097`) and `[[frame.component]]` (whole arrangement refused,
  `charter/instance.py:2400`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schema` | int (top level) | optional; absent = 1 | Project format version. charter-app understands 2, and a higher one makes the project read-only to it (V37a). `init` writes 1. A bump follows [Compatibility across charter versions](#compatibility-across-purlis-versions-fr-24). | stable | `charter/instance.py:98` |
| `requires` | array of tables (top level) | optional; absent = none. Declared with `schema = 2` (V37a) | Features a charter must have to write this project, each `{ feature, since }` (V37b). A charter that lacks one opens the project read-only and names `since` ([Compatibility across charter versions](#compatibility-across-purlis-versions-fr-24)). | **stable**, a public format commitment (V37b): read by charter-app from FR-24; written only by the `rename-plane` fix, which adds `purlis-names` (RN-7) | `crates/purlis-core/src/compat.rs` |
| `[project].id` | str, a ULID | optional; absent = none yet, minted at the first ask | **purlis only** (V76, ADR 0068 as amended by FD-26). The project's stable id: what the session protocol names a project by, in `start` and in each listed chat's `project`, never its path, which differs on every clone and device. Minted once, as a ULID like a chat's and a device's (ADR 0066), by `planefile::ensure_project_id` the first time something asks for it, and written into this file with `toml_edit`, as the Settings tab's save writes, under the plane root's lock, so two processes asking at once get one id. A `project` table written any way TOML allows (a header with a comment, spaces or quotes, an inline table, a dotted key, a subtable) gets the id inside it; a `project` that is not a table is refused. The result is parsed again before it is written and must read as holding exactly the new id, or nothing is written. **Tier:** Plane, as the whole file: committed, so every clone and device of the project names it the same. Never written over: a value that is not a ULID is reported and left as it is, and the reader treats it as none. Read in its canonical (upper-case) spelling. | stable, a public format commitment (V76) | `crates/purlis-core/src/scaffold/planefile.rs` `project_id`, `ensure_project_id` |
| `[[forge]]` | array of tables | optional; none = one default GitLab forge | One block per forge tracked. Index 0 is `config.GROUP`/`EXCLUDE`. | stable | `charter/instance.py:143` |
| `[[forge]].kind` | str | default `"gitlab"`; one of `gitlab`, `github` | Backend class. Unknown kind = that block skipped + reported. | stable | `charter/forge/registry.py:69`, `charter/forge/registry.py:15` |
| `[[forge]].group` / `.owner` | str | optional; `group` wins, else `owner`, else `""` | Org/group whose repos are discovered. | stable | `charter/instance.py:162` |
| `[[forge]].host` | str | optional; default `gitlab.com` / `github.com` | Self-hosted host. Must match `_HOST_RE` (bare host, optional `:port`) or the block is refused. | stable | `charter/forge/registry.py:29`, `charter/forge/registry.py:56` |
| `[[forge]].exclude` | array of str | optional; default `()` | Repo names never written to the inventory; per block. | stable | `charter/instance.py:170` |
| `[memory].share` | str | default `"local"`; one of `local`,`commit`,`push` | How far a written memory travels. Unknown value clamps to `local`. **In purlis, a deprecated alias of `[plane].mode`** (`local`→*not set*, `commit`→`commit`, `push`→`push`); `[plane].mode` wins when both are present, and `doctor` warns (ADR 0051). | stable | `charter/instance.py:466`, `charter/instance.py:265` |
| `[workspace].default` | str | default `"default"` | Workspace used when nothing else selected. Validated by `workspace_name_ok` (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` + `contain.segment_ok`); invalid → fallback. | stable | `charter/instance.py:243`, `charter/instance.py:181` |
| `[persona].default` | str | optional; blank = absent = `None` | The plane's front door persona. Written by `purlis persona default`. | stable | `charter/instance.py:259` |
| `[plane].worktrees` | str | optional; `None` = `workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/` | Relocated worktree root. Relative resolves against ROOT; a committed value must satisfy `contain.plane_adjacent` or it is ignored (doctor warns). `$CHARTER_WORKTREES` overrides and is unrestricted. | stable | `charter/instance.py:488`, `charter/config.py:82` |
| `[plane].mode` | str | optional; closed set `off`,`commit`,`push`,`pr`,`pr-merge`; absent = `[memory].share`'s alias when that is `commit` or `push`, else **ask once** (the Saving view asks before anything is pushed); a new plane is written with `push` | **charter-app only.** How far a save of the plane goes, as a ladder: `off` never commits; `commit` commits locally; `push` also pushes to `branch`; `pr` pushes to `save_branch` and opens or updates one PR/MR into `branch`; `pr-merge` also sets that PR to auto-merge. `pr`/`pr-merge` on an origin that is not a GitHub or GitLab forge charter knows is a config error (doctor, the settings tab): saves stop at a local commit, shown as a notice, and the plane is not blocked. Unknown value → refused by the settings tab, read as absent. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit/prsave.rs` |
| `[plane].branch` | str | optional; default the branch the plane has checked out | **purlis only.** The *target* branch the plane is saved into. A save whose plane has another branch checked out commits and does not push: pushing would rebase that branch onto this one (ADR 0051). | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit.rs` |
| `[plane].save_branch` | str | optional; default `purlis/save/<host>-<clone>` (`charter/save/<host>-<clone>` before the rename, which a clone whose PR is still open from it keeps using until a save sees that PR merged or closed, V93j): `<host>` is the machine's short hostname, by the rule the dispatch log used before FD-25 (`dispatch::host`); a branch name is something the operator reads, so it stays a name (ADR 0066), `<clone>` the first six hex digits of the SHA-256 of the plane's absolute path, so two clones, or two machines with one name, never share one | **charter-app only.** The one rolling branch per clone that `pr`/`pr-merge` push to; one PR from it is kept open and updated by every save. Replaces the per-push `purlis/<sha>` branch (`charter/<sha>` before the rename, still advanced while its request waits) for the request modes. Only this branch is ever force-pushed, with `--force-with-lease` against the commit this clone last pushed there (`save-branch.json`); with none kept it is leased as absent, and an existing branch is pushed over only when its tip is already in HEAD's history — otherwise the plane is blocked. Must not be the target branch (a config error, and the plane is blocked). A value shared in `charter.toml` is one branch for every clone, and the lease then blocks all but the first. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit/prsave.rs` (charter-app#298) |
| `[plane].sign` | bool | optional; default `false` | **purlis only.** Sign save commits. (ADR 0051 also has a push refused for an unsigned commit tell the operator to set this; that hint is not built.) | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit.rs` |
| `[plane].autosave` | bool | optional; default `true` | **purlis only.** Save by itself: after `autosave_after` of quiet, when a session ends, and when the app quits (the push gets about five seconds; the next launch pushes what was left). Also fast-forwards a clean tree from the remote every five minutes and on window focus; with `false`, incoming commits are shown, not pulled. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/autosave.rs`, `app/src-tauri/src/autosave.rs` |
| `[plane].autosave_after` | str | optional; default `"30s"`; a whole number followed by `s` or `m` | **purlis only.** The quiet period after the last change before an auto-save. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/autosave.rs` |
| `[plane].assisted_by` | str | optional; default `"full"`; one of `full`, `llm`, in any case; a `[repos.<name>]` that does not set it follows this one | How a commit an agent run made spells its `Assisted-by` trailer: `full` is `<harness>:<model>`, `llm` is the kernel's bare `LLM`. See *Provenance trailers* below. | stable | V67; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/provenance.rs` |
| `[repos.<name>]` | table | optional, one per repo | **charter-app only.** How a workspace repo is saved. `<name>` is the repo's `name` in `inventory/repos.json`, so one table governs every workspace's clone of it. Takes the same keys as `[plane]` (`mode`, `branch`, `sign`, `autosave`, `autosave_after`, `assisted_by`) except `save_branch`, with the defaults `mode = "off"` (charter never commits, pushes or opens a PR for a repo until its mode says how — ADR 0051, amended 2026-09-25) and `autosave = false`. A save commits on the branch the clone is on and `pr` opens its PR from that branch into `branch` (default: the repo's `default_branch`); on that default branch, a request mode first creates `purlis/<workspace>/<short-sha>`, or carries on a `charter/<workspace>/…` branch an earlier save made, while HEAD descends from it. It never runs while a session in that workspace is mid-turn. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/reposave.rs` |
| any other key in `[plane]` or `[repos.<name>]` | — | — | Refused by the Settings tab's save, ignored by readers. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs` `refusals` |
| `[charter].version` | str | optional | The version lock. Reported **as written** (even if malformed); must match `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` before it is acted on. | stable | `charter/instance.py:321`, `charter/instance.py:290` |
| `[update].channel` | str | default `"stable"`; closed set `stable`,`dev` | Which purlis this plane tracks. Unknown → `stable`; the matched **constant** is stored, never the file's string. | stable | `charter/instance.py:2948`, `charter/instance.py:2936` |
| `[harness].default` | str | default `None` | What bare `purlis` launches. Matched against the harness registry's `cli_name`s; a non-match is recorded as `refused` (contained) rather than ignored. | stable | `charter/instance.py:3000`, `charter/instance.py:3088` |
| `[harness.<name>]` | table | — | **Refused here**: profiles live in `charter.local.toml`. Reported by name. | stable | `charter/profiles.py:316`, `charter/profiles.py:132` |
| `[extensions.<id>].enabled` | bool | optional; absent = this machine's answer (an approved extension is on) | **purlis only** (purlis#253, ADR 0048). Whether this project has the extension on. It cannot reach past this machine's approval: `true` for an extension this machine has not approved reads as *needs approval here* and contributes nothing. `charter.local.toml`'s value overrides this one, and in a workspace, that workspace's `settings.extensions.<id>.enabled` in `workspace.json` comes between the two (purlis#280). `<id>` is an extension's id (letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`, starting with a letter or digit). | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve` |
| `[extensions.<id>.settings].<key>` | bool or str | optional; absent = the extension's declared default | **purlis only.** A value for a setting the extension's manifest declares (`bool`, `text` of at most 200 bytes, or one of a `choice`'s words), handed to its program with each question as `settings`. A key it does not declare, or a value it would not accept, is ignored with a sentence and the next file down is used. Overridden key by key by `charter.local.toml`. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve`, `crates/purlis-core/src/extension.rs` `Setting::accepts` |
| any other key in `[extensions.<id>]` | — | — | Refused by the Settings tab's save, and ignored by the reader. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `refusals` |
| `[harness_plugins.<harness>]."<plugin id>"` | bool | optional; absent = not set (the harness decides, from its own settings) | **charter-app only** (charter-app#274, ADR 0050). Whether the chats charter starts in this project have that harness plugin on (`true`) or off (`false`). `<harness>` is a profile `kind`: `claude`, `opencode` or `codex`. `<plugin id>` is the harness's own id (`<name>@<marketplace>` for Claude Code and Codex), one line of at most 200 bytes. Only a plugin this machine has installed is handed on. `charter.local.toml`'s value overrides this one plugin by plugin, and for a chat in a workspace, that workspace's `settings.harness_plugins.<harness>."<plugin id>"` in `workspace.json` comes between the two (charter-app#282). For Claude Code the value goes into the chat's `--settings` `enabledPlugins`. For Codex and opencode it is read, shown as *not supported yet*, and handed to nothing. `charter-app@inline` cannot be `false` and `charter@charter` cannot be `true` under `claude`: a save that says so is refused, and the reader ignores it with a sentence. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` `resolve`, `chosen` |
| any other shape under `[harness_plugins]` | — | — | A harness purlis does not know, a value that is not a bool, or a `[harness_plugins]` or `[harness_plugins.<harness>]` that is not a table is refused by the Settings tab's save and ignored by the reader. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` `refusals` |
| `[sandbox].mode` | str | optional; absent = **not set**: the plane's chats run as they did before the sandbox existed | **charter-app only** (ADR 0067, program map SD-2). `"on"` is the one value a plane may give it: every chat charter starts in the plane runs in a sandbox charter compiles for its harness, or does not start. **A project `charter init` or the app makes writes `[sandbox]` with `mode = "on"` and the default `egress`** (ADR 0067 §1, ruling V21 1 and 5); a project made before that is offered it once in the window, and taking the offer writes the same block (`sandbox::local::answer`). A person may start **one chat** without it, from the window's new-chat picker only ("Start without the sandbox", ruling V78 a; no CLI word); a system with no sandbox backend (Windows) starts every chat without it (V21 3). Each such start, and the sandbox coming back on for that chat's next run, is a `trust.sandbox.off` or `trust.sandbox.on` event in the host's event log. **A plane can never carry `"off"`**: a committed file may restrict what a chat is confined to and never loosen it, so `"off"`, or any value that is not `"on"` (a typo included), is refused by the Settings tab's save and **read as `"on"`**, with a sentence. So is a `sandbox` that is not a table. A `[sandbox]` with no `mode` is not set. Only a person turns the sandbox off, for one chat. What a chat may write (its own directory and a temp directory, for a harness charter wraps whole that harness's own data, and while `toolchains` is in `egress` the project's own package caches, which purlis keeps under its data home and points cargo, npm, pip, Go, Gradle, yarn and pnpm at, never the person's own; that costs disk and a first download per project) and the denial classes (ADR 0067 §5) are not keys: no file can widen them. Read from this file only; `charter.local.toml`'s `[sandbox]` holds this machine's own `hosts` and nothing else. What it covers and what it does not is in `SECURITY.md`. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` `Said::of` |
| `[sandbox].egress` | array of str | optional; absent = `["model-providers", "forge", "toolchains"]` | **purlis only** (ADR 0067 §3). The named presets whose hosts a sandboxed chat may reach; a host none of them lists is refused. `forge` also holds the hosts of this file's `[[forge]]` blocks. `[]` reaches no host. A word that is not a preset is refused with a sentence and the rest are kept. SD-4 and SD-31 add presets. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` `Said::of`, `hosts` |
| `[sandbox].hosts` | array of str | optional; absent = `[]` | **purlis only** (ADR 0067 §1 and §3 as amended 2026-10-06; #1341). **The project's own hosts**, beside the presets: every chat of everyone who opens the project reaches them, with no approval, and each teammate's window tells them once when the list changes (`app/sandbox.json` `hosts_seen`). An entry is a domain (`api.example.com`), `*.domain` (every name under it, never the domain itself, and never a whole top-level domain), an IPv4 address or a bracketed IPv6 address (`[fd00::1]`), each with an optional `:port`; private ranges are hosts like any other (`10.100.39.145:6443`). A host without a port is reached as a preset's host is on each harness (any port on Claude Code; HTTPS's and HTTP's through purlis's egress proxy for opencode and Codex); with a port, on that port alone, on every harness. An IPv6 address that carries an IPv4 one (NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96`, IPv4-compatible `::/96`, 6to4 `2002::/16`, SIIT) is judged as that IPv4 address. Never a host, and refused with a sentence that drops the entry: this machine (`localhost`, loopback, `0.0.0.0/8`), link-local addresses, broadcast and multicast, the cloud metadata addresses Claude Code's sandbox refuses (`100.100.100.200`, `168.63.129.16`, `192.0.0.192`, `fd00:ec2::/32` and the rest), a name or wildcard ending in a number (`0x7f.1`, `*.0.0.1`: an address written another way), a range, a URL or a path, a single name with no dot, and an IPv4 address written as IPv6. An address that is one of this machine's own interface addresses is dropped when a chat starts. Through purlis's egress proxy a wildcard never matches an address, and a name is reached only at the addresses it resolves to that a chat may reach — never this machine, link-local, multicast, broadcast or metadata — checked at every connect; an address literal is held to the same check, and the one exception is that exact address and port, listed (#1664). Changed in Settings › Sandbox (Add and Remove); the host field is checked as it is typed, by `Host::parse`, with the sentence Add would refuse it with. A chat never writes it: the manifest is a later-code name a sandboxed chat is denied writing, and that denial is the boundary today; `sandbox::changes_a_sandbox_key` is the rule a brokered write asks once #1333 builds one. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox/hosts.rs` `Host::parse`, `in_force`; `crates/purlis-core/src/settings/hosts.rs` |
| `[sandbox].certificate-checks` | bool | optional; absent = `false` | **purlis only** (#1337). `true` lets a sandboxed chat on macOS ask the system's certificate check, which Go tools such as `gh` need to verify certificates; it also lets a chat reach hosts named inside a certificate, past the egress proxy, so it is off unless set. A value that is not `true` or `false` is refused with a sentence and read as `false`. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` `Said::of` |
| `[sandbox.personas.<persona>].hosts` | array of str | optional; absent = `[]` | **purlis only** (ADR 0067 §1 as amended; #1362, the **Persona** level). Hosts the chats running as `<persona>` reach, beside the presets, the project's hosts and yours; a chat on another persona does not, and a chat that names none takes the default persona's (`[persona] default`). Fixed when the chat starts. A chat opened by another chat's handoff holds the grants the asking chat itself runs with instead (from the app's own record, its own hold included), and a chat resumed from a session record as a persona wider than the default holds the default's, until the person presses Allow on its tab, unless every host is already reached (D-1362-5, D-1362-6). A persona chat started by a dispatch that a dispatch grant covers holds its own from its first command, with nothing to allow on its tab (#1437): the grant is the person's consent to the pair. The hold is `reopen.json`'s per-chat `held` (the persona's name, `""` for none; any other value reads as holding none). Each entry is written and checked as `[sandbox].hosts`'s are, and one that is not a host is refused and dropped. Kept here, in the committed file, and not in the persona's `persona.md`, which a chat may edit: a chat never writes this one: the manifest is a later-code name a sandboxed chat is denied writing, and `sandbox::changes_a_sandbox_key` counts any change under `[sandbox]` for a brokered write once #1333 builds one. **In force on a machine only once the person there allowed them** (D-1362-7): a teammate can change this list, and its hosts reach past the presets into private networks, so the project view asks on each machine with a Notice of its own that shows the list as a chat would reach it (none a policy locks out), and Allow (there, or in Settings › Sandbox) keeps the digest of exactly that list and of whether `<persona>` is the project's `[persona] default`, whose hosts then reach every chat that names no persona too (`app/sandbox.json` `persona_hosts_mine`). Any change to either after that, a host added or taken away or the default moved, grants none of the list until it is allowed again, even should it change back, and Granted lists the old Allow as waiting, with Revoke; the order the list is written in is no change. A private address or port is taken only as one exact address and port: a range, a wildcard over addresses and a port range are refused. The Allow is audited, listed in Settings › Sandbox › Granted credited to the persona, and revoked there; it is the window's alone, never a chat's or a link's. A key other than `hosts` under a persona, or a name that is not a persona's, is refused with a sentence. Policy can forbid persona hosts (`hosts::Locks`, #1343). | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox/persona.rs` `read`; `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` `Compiled::of` |

A dispatch past one of the others is refused, and the asking chat is told which. A whole number of 0 or more; **`0` switches dispatch off** at the level that sets it, and a more specific level may set it back above 0 (a policy's 0 is a ceiling nothing lifts); `messages-per-minute = 0` stops messages only, never a dispatch; **`depth` is never above `8`**, and a higher one is refused by the Settings tab's save and not read. A value that is not such a number, or any other key, is refused with a sentence and the level beneath it is in force. Read afresh for every dispatch, so a change applies to the next one. Changed in Settings › Project › Dispatch. A sandboxed chat never writes it: the manifest is a later-code name a sandboxed chat is denied writing, and a brokered write refuses any change under `[dispatch]` (`brokered::guard`); a chat that runs without the sandbox runs as the person and can. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchlimits.rs` `read`, `in_force`, `decide` |
| `[dispatch].tokens-per-session`, `.minutes-per-task` | int | optional; absent = no limit | **purlis only** (#1512, V100-59). **Two limits that are off until set**, at the same levels and by the same rules as the four above (a workspace's or a persona's row may set them, the most specific level wins, this machine's own table only lowers, a policy caps). Each is a whole number of 1 or more (`tokens-per-session` at most 1,000,000,000, `minutes-per-task` at most 10,000): **a `0` is refused with a sentence**, since it would switch nothing off, and the level beneath it is in force. **`minutes-per-task`** is how long one task may *work*: its working time, counted by the app while its turn runs and it shows no prompt, never while it waits on the person or on its own tasks, nor while purlis is not running; kept on its dispatch record (`worked`), so a task put back after a restart keeps the minutes it had. It is held at the stricter of the dispatch's levels and the workspace the task works in. **Past it** the app asks that task, and everything below it, for its report, the way Stop and get its report asks (one short turn, then its end), with purlis's own line, and the chat that asked is told which limit, with the figure, never that the person ended it; the record says `ended_by: "limit"` and keeps `limit`. A task showing a prompt or a question, or one the person has typed into since its harness last spoke, or with such a task below it, is left for the next look. The app looks at a project as soon as its chats are put back (at a launch, once you have answered what to reopen) and then every 30 seconds, and reads the files afresh each time, so a limit raised in Settings lets a task go on; where neither key is set anywhere, it reads nothing else. **`tokens-per-session` is read and shown, and not enforced yet**: the session's row shows its figure (the chat the person started and every task below it, open or ended, as their harnesses reported them) against the limit, with "not enforced yet", and no dispatch is refused and no task stopped by it. The figure is kept by each chat's id where no sandboxed chat can write it (`app/spend/<chat>.json`, #1457, D-1452-12); a chat with no sandbox runs as the person and can still write it. A harness that reports no tokens is not counted, and Settings says so | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchlimits.rs` `time_reached`, `tokens_past`; `app/src-tauri/src/overlimit.rs` |
| `[dispatch.workspaces.<workspace>].<limit>` | int | optional | **purlis only** (#1440). A workspace's own value for any of the four limits above, for chats working in it. **The most specific level wins** (a persona's over a workspace's over the project's) and a level that does not set a limit inherits it. Kept here and not in the workspace's `workspace.json`. Changed in Settings › Project › Dispatch (Add an override) and on the workspace's settings. A name that is not a workspace's is refused with a sentence. | stable | same |

A persona's own value for any of the four limits, for chats that ask as it, and its two own: `may-dispatch`, the persona chats the chats running as it may have running between them in the whole project, and `may-run-at-once`, the chats that may run as it at once in the whole project. Each count is of chats that still owe work: not yet reported, and their program not ended. `0` for either stops it dispatching, or being dispatched to. **Kept here, in the committed file, and never in the persona's `persona.md`**, which a chat may edit: nothing reads a limit from a persona's own file. Changed in Settings › Project › Dispatch and on the persona's view. The two caps under `[dispatch]` or a workspace are refused with a sentence. | stable | same |
| `[dispatch.grants].<persona>` | array of str, or of `{ to, in }` tables | optional; absent = `[]` | **purlis only** (#1437, spec #1434; ADR 0090). **The project's dispatch grants**: the personas a chat running as `<persona>` may dispatch to with no prompt, for everyone who opens the project (`steward = ["devops"]`). Written by the grant Notice's **Allow for everyone in this project**, and by **Add a grant** for everyone in Settings › Project › Dispatch (#1465), which makes one with no dispatch waiting, held to every rule an Allow is held to and audited as the person's; taken out by Settings' Revoke. **A pair is in force on a machine only once someone there allowed it** (`app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_seen`): one a pull brought in covers no chat until the person there accepts it, on the Notice the window shows when it arrives (#1506: **Accept** for the pairs it lists, **Not on my machine** for all it lists), in Settings, or on the tab of a chat that asks; a chat nobody is at is refused meanwhile. A pair allowed in a machine's own window is in force there as it is written. Accepting never writes this file. **A machine's yes is bound to what it accepted** (#1506): a grant a commit takes out of this file is no longer accepted there, so one taken out and put back waits for a new yes, also when both commits arrive in one pull, and whichever of this file's names each commit used (`app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_seen_at`). A grant the file on disk does not hold is not in force, and nothing is dropped for that alone. A grant naming a persona the checkout does not define is told as covering nothing and is not accepted. **`"*"` in a persona's list is "any persona"** (#1503, `steward = ["*"]`): chats running as that persona may dispatch to every persona of the project, one added later included, with no prompt. Only Settings › Project › Dispatch writes it, never an answer to the grant Notice, which keeps the one pair it asked about. It is in force on a machine only once someone there accepted it in Settings (`app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_any_seen`, a record of its own: nothing that accepts a pair accepts it). **No Notice accepts it**: the Notice that says a teammate's grant arrived tells of it in its own sentence and may decline it, and the command behind that Notice refuses to accept one. It is one-way like any grant, a policy lock and your own never for a pair (`app/dispatch-never.json`) both hold under it, and the loop rule is as it was. **For a chat nobody is at it counts in that chat's own workspace only**: such a chat starts a chat as another persona in another workspace only under a grant that names the pair (`dispatchplace::nobody_to_ask`). Only the exact string `"*"` means it: a `"*"` where the asking persona goes, or a pattern such as `"dev*"`, is refused with a sentence and grants nothing. **A grant may be limited to one workspace** (#1505; ADR 0090 as amended): an entry of the list that is a table of exactly two keys, `steward = ["qa", { to = "devops", in = "runners" }]`, lets chats running as `steward` dispatch to `devops` only for a task that **works in** the workspace `runners`, whichever chat asks and wherever that chat is: the workspace a dispatch names with `--in workspace:<name>`, the one whose repo a worktree is cut from, the one a handoff moves into, else the asking chat's own. A task at the project's root works in no workspace, so no limited grant covers it. `to` is a persona's name or `"*"`, and `in` is a workspace's name as its folder under `workspaces/` spells it, compared exactly. **A string entry holds in any workspace, as it always did; the table is the only spelling of a limit, so a build that knows only names reads a limited grant as no grant, never as one that holds everywhere.** A table with a key missing, a key more, or a value that is not such a name is refused with a sentence and grants nothing: a missing `in` is never read as "any workspace", and a condition a later build adds is not dropped to widen the grant. Written by **Allow for everyone in this project** on a question about a task that works in a workspace (the narrower grant is what that answer means; *in any workspace* is the person's explicit other choice there), and changed or taken out in Settings › Project › Dispatch. A limited grant is in force on a machine only once someone there allowed it, as its own acceptance (`app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_seen_in`): accepting the pair for one workspace never accepts it for every workspace, or the reverse, and a teammate's limited grant waits in Settings with **Accept**; the project's one-time Notice does not name it. It counts only while its workspace is there (`app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_workspaces`). For a chat nobody is at, crossing into another workspace needs a grant that names the pair and holds in any workspace or is limited to **the workspace it crosses into**. **Nothing in this file says never, or lifts one**: a never is the person's, on their machine. A dispatch to a chat's own persona needs no grant, so a persona listed under itself is refused with a sentence, as is a name that is not a persona's, a value that is not a list, or a `grants` that is not a table: each grants nothing. Read whether or not the project's chats are sandboxed, never through a link, and none from a file that cannot be read. A sandboxed chat never writes it: the manifest is a later-code name a sandboxed chat is denied writing, and a brokered write refuses any change under `[dispatch]` (`brokered::guard`). **That denial is the sandbox's and nothing else's**: in a project with the sandbox off, or for a chat a person started without it, the chat runs as the person and can write this file and `app/sandbox.json`, so there a dispatch grant is not protected from a chat. An administrator's policy can lock a pair or all dispatch, a persona's dispatch to itself included where the pair names it twice (`/etc/purlis/policy.json` `dispatch`). The other two levels of a dispatch grant are not in this file: one chat's is the app's, in memory, and yours is `app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_mine`. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchgrant.rs` `committed`, `covers`; `crates/purlis-core/src/settings/dispatch.rs` |
| `[dispatch.profiles].<persona>` | array of str | optional; absent = no list | **purlis only** (#1509, spec #1483; ruling V100-60). **The harness profiles a chat dispatched to `<persona>` may start on** (`devops = ["work", "codex"]`). A dispatch chooses a profile three ways: the asking chat names one (`purlis dispatch --profile`), else the persona's own definition does (`profile:`), else it is the asking chat's own. Where a persona is held to a list, **the profile chosen is one of those listed, whoever chose it**, or nothing starts, and the refusal names the profiles listed and says what its reader can do. **Every dispatch is held to it**: a task, a handoff, a dispatch the person allowed later, and the person's own "Ask a persona" from a chat's tab. **So is a dispatched chat each time it is started again** (when purlis is opened again, Restart chat, the restart a grant owes, Start fresh): one whose recorded profile the project has since stopped listing is not started, and its row says why. The same start refuses a dispatched chat whose profile's command has come to carry a flag purlis knows for switching the harness's permission prompts off. **A persona with no list of its own is held to the list of the persona it `extends:`**, the nearest one up its chain that has a list. There is no list for every persona at once: a persona nobody listed, whose chain lists none, may be dispatched to on any profile the project offers on this machine, as before this key existed. Names are exact and case-sensitive, with blanks around an entry trimmed. **A list only ever narrows**: a name in it is still looked up among the profiles the project offers on this machine, still needs its approval there, and is still refused where its command carries one of those flags; a listed name this machine does not offer starts nothing. So a list a pull brought in lets a chat start on nothing it could not start on without it, and nobody acknowledges it. **What cannot be read narrows too**: an empty list, or a value that is not a list, lists nothing, so no chat is dispatched to that persona until a person fixes it; an entry that is not a profile's name is dropped; a `profiles` that is not a table, or a project file that is there and cannot be read (not TOML, reached through a link, too large), lists nothing for every persona; a name that is not a persona's lists nothing. Each is said in a sentence. **Kept here, in the committed file, and never in the persona's `persona.md`**, which a chat may edit. A sandboxed chat never writes it: the manifest is a later-code name a sandboxed chat is denied writing, and a brokered write refuses any change under `[dispatch]` (`brokered::guard`). That denial is the sandbox's: in a project with the sandbox off, a chat runs as the person and can write this file. It is not read from this machine's own file (`[dispatch.profiles]` there is refused with a sentence). The person's own start of a chat from the new-chat picker is not a dispatch and is not held to it. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchprofiles.rs` `listed`, `listed_at`, `may_start_again`; `crates/purlis-core/src/personaprofile.rs` `for_dispatch` |

The theme the window and its terminals draw while this project is in front: `charter-dark`, `charter-light`, `system` (the built-in matching the operating system's appearance, followed live), or `<extension-id>/<theme name>` — split at the first `/`. An extension's theme is drawn only while the extension is on in this project and approved on this machine, and contributes that theme; otherwise the built-in `charter-dark` is drawn and the Settings tab says why. A value of none of those shapes is ignored with a sentence and the next file down is used. `charter.local.toml`'s value overrides this one, and in a workspace, that workspace's `settings.theme.use` in `workspace.json` comes between the two (purlis#281). | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve` |

The icon theme the file trees draw while this project is in front: `charter-icons` (charter's own, from Material Icon Theme, MIT), or `<extension-id>/<icon theme name>`, one an extension contributes as `contributes.icon_themes` — an object per icon theme with a `name` and a `file`, as `contributes.themes` has. Picked apart from `use`, in the same order (`charter.local.toml` over the workspace's `settings.theme.icons` over this file). An extension's icon theme is drawn only while the extension is on and approved; otherwise `charter-icons` is drawn. The file is data — symbols of path outlines coloured by the `icon.*` tokens, mapped from extensions, file names and folder names — read by `app/src/theme/icons.ts`, which keeps nothing that could run or fetch. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve_icons` |

#### `[frame]` — every key, via `FRAME_FIELDS` (`charter/instance.py:1652`)

Merged over `FRAME_DEFAULTS` by `frame_of` (`charter/instance.py:1994`); the section must be a
table or the defaults are returned whole (`charter/instance.py:2064`). Only the **TOML
spelling** is honoured — three keys are hyphenated; the underscore form is not an alias.
Type-checked against the default (`charter/instance.py:2147`: a `bool`/non-`bool` mismatch is
rejected first, then `isinstance(value, type(default))`).

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `slots` | list[str] | `["top","bottom","repos","right"]` | Edges to draw, **in split order (geometry)**. Filtered against `FRAME_SLOTS` (`top`,`bottom`,`repos`,`right`); an empty result is treated as "not written". | stable | `charter/instance.py:1682`, `charter/instance.py:564` |
| `density` | str | `"full"` | Preset over `slots`: `minimal`/`normal`/`full`. Expands to `slots` **only when declared and no usable explicit `slots`**. Carries a `verbosity` (`terse`/`normal`). | stable | `charter/instance.py:1692`, `charter/instance.py:628` |
| `mouse` | bool | `false` | tmux mouse reporting. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1752` |
| `chrome` | str | `"off"` | Pane surface: `off`/`dark`/`light`. Word is a key into `FRAME_CHROME`; never a style string. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1766`, `charter/instance.py:729` |
| `rules` | str | `"hidden"` | Pane-seam treatment: `hidden`/`visible`. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1788`, `charter/instance.py:1161` |
| `text` | str | `"default"` | Frame foreground; one of `FRAME_PANE_FG`'s 17 words (`default`, 8 ANSI names, 8 `bright*`). | stable | `charter/instance.py:1796`, `charter/instance.py:983` |
| `dim` | bool | `true` | Whether SGR 2 is appended to purlis's rules. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1816` |
| `ok` / `warn` / `bad` | str | `"green"` / `"yellow"` / `"red"` | Accent colours; same 17-word vocabulary as `text`. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1845` |
| `hotkey` | str | `"F2"` | Palette key. Must match `_HOTKEY_RE` **and** differ from the frame gate key, or it degrades to the default — a newline here reached tmux config text (measured RCE). | stable | `charter/instance.py:1848`, `charter/instance.py:1937`, `charter/instance.py:2134` |
| `record` | bool | `true` | Whether the frame writes the plane down as it changes. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1858` |
| `restore` | bool | `true` | Whether bare `purlis` puts the recorded plane back. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1870` |

| `min-rows` | int | `20` | Same, vertically. | stable | `charter/instance.py:1873` |

#### `[[frame.component]]` — the arrangement (`charter/instance.py:2421`)

An array of tables; the whole arrangement is **refused as one** on the first bad key
(`charter/instance.py:2400` carries the sentence, and `frame_of` stores it as
`components_refused`, `charter/instance.py:2158`). When accepted it **replaces** `slots`
(`charter/instance.py:2160`). The complete key form is
`("use","edge","size","visible","key","bg","pad")` (`charter/instance.py:2204`) — any other
key refuses.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `use` | str | required, unique | Component id: a built-in (`identity`, `attention`, `repos`, `sidebar`, `personas`, `todos`, `changes`, `chats`, `workspaces` — `charter/frame/builtins.py:985`ff) or an id an installed distribution supplies. | stable | `charter/instance.py:2624`, `charter/instance.py:2802` |
| `edge` | str | required for a non-built-in; for a built-in it may only **echo** its own edge | One of `top`,`bottom`,`left`,`right` (`charter/frame/component.py:55`). | stable | `charter/instance.py:2801`, `charter/instance.py:2758` |
| `size` | int | required (≥1) for a non-built-in; for a built-in only where the built-in's size is `Content`, else it may only echo | Cells. | stable | `charter/instance.py:2811`, `charter/instance.py:2273` |
| `visible` | bool | default `true` | Whether it is drawn at launch (invisible components still get a toggle key). | stable | `charter/instance.py:2661` |
| `key` | str | optional | tmux toggle key; `toggle_key`/`_HOTKEY_RE`, and refused if already bound (palette, hatch, gate, mouse keys, another component). | stable | `charter/instance.py:2667`, `charter/instance.py:2710` |
| `bg` | str | optional | One of `FRAME_PANE_BG`'s 17 words. | stable | `charter/instance.py:2725`, `charter/instance.py:886` |
| `pad` | int | default `0`, max `5` | Horizontal inset, out of the content budget; `bool` refused. | stable | `charter/instance.py:2742`, `charter/instance.py:1046` |

### `charter.local.toml`

- **Format:** TOML. Hand-edited (or edited by a chat), and in purlis written by the
  Settings tab and nothing else.
- **Status:** **stable** — the operator edits it by hand, and two different processes read it
  (the CLI/`doctor`, and the frame launcher/selector on a launch).
- **Tier:** Clone state — the operator's per-clone profiles and overrides, gitignored and hand-edited, so nothing can rebuild it.
- **Written by:** nothing in the Python charter — `purlis init`/`reinit` only add the
  `.gitignore` line for it (`charter/commands.py:1803`, `charter/commands.py:1806`).
  purlis's Settings tab (`purlis_core::settings::save`, purlis#252) writes it
  as it writes `charter.toml` (above), and **creates it on the first save**, at mode 0600. It
  refuses to create or write the file where git would commit it — asked before the file exists
  with `git check-ignore -q -- charter.local.toml` (exit 1 is "would commit", and is also git's
  answer for a tracked path), and afterwards with the loader's own `ignore_check` — in the
  loader's own sentences, and refuses anything `profiles` would refuse in it.
- **Read by:** `charter/profiles.py:240` `_read_local` (the only reader), through
  `charter/profiles.py:284` `derive` and `charter/profiles.py:404` `current` (memoized per
  process on `(root, local bytes, charter.toml bytes)`, `charter/profiles.py:428`). Surfaces:
  `purlis harness list` (`charter/commands_harness.py:62`), `purlis doctor`
  (`charter/doctor.py:755`), the launcher/selector (`charter/frame/launcher.py:478`,
  `charter/frame/selector.py:25`). In purlis, its `[extensions]` table is read by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` as `charter.toml`'s is (purlis#253), and
  its `[theme]` by `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` (purlis#273), and
  its `[harness_plugins]` table by `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` as
  `charter.toml`'s is (purlis#274), and its `[plane]` and `[repos.<name>]` tables by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs` as `charter.toml`'s are (purlis#292), and its
  `[chat_env]` table by `crates/purlis-core/src/chatenv.rs` on every chat start.
- **Git:** gitignored — the baseline writes `/charter.local.toml`
  (`charter/commands.py:1104`), and `reinit` backfills it
  (`charter/commands.py:1821`). If git *would* carry it (tracked, committable, or git cannot
  say), **every profile in it is refused** (`charter/profiles.py:518` `ignore_check`,
  `charter/profiles.py:456` `with_ignore_check`). In purlis, **nothing in it is read**
  then: its `[extensions]`, `[theme]`, `[harness_plugins]`, `[plane]`, `[repos.<name>]` and
  `[chat_env]` are left out too, and the other
  layers decide (purlis#308, ADR 0048). Every reader takes the file through
  `crates/purlis-core/src/settings.rs` `layer_text`, which applies the same check.
- **Encoding details:** only `[harness]` is read by the profiles loader, and — in purlis
  since purlis#253 — `[extensions]` by `extension::project` and, since purlis#273,
  `[theme]` by `extension::project::theme` (ADR 0048), and, since purlis#274,
  `[harness_plugins]` by `harness_plugin` (ADR 0050), and, since purlis#292, `[plane]`
  and `[repos.<name>]` by `planesave` (ADR 0051), which override `charter.toml`'s values
  **key by key** on ADR 0048's overlay, every surface that shows one naming the file that
  decided it, and `[chat_env]` by `chatenv` (ADR 0047, amendment of 2026-09-29), which has no
  counterpart in `charter.toml`; any other top-level key is refused with a sentence
  (`charter/profiles.py:325`, and in purlis `crates/purlis-core/src/profiles.rs`
  `derive_from`, whose sentence names all seven tables). A missing file declares nothing and is not a refusal
  (`charter/profiles.py:241`). Profile `env` is stored **sorted by name**
  (`charter/profiles.py:363`), and `~` in `command[0]` and in every `env` value is expanded
  only at launch (`charter/profiles.py:474`, `charter/profiles.py:480`) — never in the file
  and never in the launch record.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Name must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$` (no dot), may not be `default`, may not collide with a `purlis` command word, and replaces a built-in of the same name (a *refused* one takes the name with it). | stable | `charter/profiles.py:69`, `charter/profiles.py:255`, `charter/profiles.py:443`, `charter/profiles.py:359` |
| `…​.kind` | str | required | The word typed after `charter`: `claude`/`codex`/`opencode` (registry `cli_name`s), or in charter-app the name of a harness the project declares in [`harnesses/<name>.toml`](#harnessesnametoml--a-harness-declaration) (ADR 0073), which a profile then also asks approval for. | stable | `charter/profiles.py:257`; `crates/purlis-core/src/profiles.rs` `refusal` |

| `…​.env` | table of str→str | optional, default `{}` | Environment for the harness process. A name starting `CHARTER_` is refused; a name containing `KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD` (case-insensitive) is refused. | stable | `charter/profiles.py:265`, `charter/profiles.py:89`, `charter/profiles.py:58` |

| `[extensions.<id>].enabled` | bool | optional | **purlis only** (purlis#253, ADR 0048). This machine's choice for this project, over `charter.toml`'s. Same shape and rules as there; still cannot reach past this machine's approval. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve` |
| `[extensions.<id>.settings].<key>` | bool or str | optional | **purlis only.** Overrides `charter.toml`'s value for the same key, key by key; falls through to it (then to the declared default) when the extension would not accept this one. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve` |
| `[theme].use` | str | optional | **purlis only** (purlis#273, ADR 0048). This machine's pick of the project's theme, over `charter.toml`'s and over a workspace's `settings.theme.use` (purlis#281). Same values and rules as there; falls through to the next layer's pick when it is none of the shapes. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve` |
| `[plane].<key>`, `[repos.<name>].<key>` | as in `charter.toml` | optional | **purlis only.** This machine's value, over `charter.toml`'s, key by key. Same shapes and refusals. | stable | ADR 0051; `crates/purlis-core/src/planesave.rs` `Settings::from_text` |
| `[sandbox].hosts` | list[str] | optional, default `[]` | **purlis only** (#1341, ADR 0067 §1 as amended: the **You** level). Hosts this machine's chats in this project reach besides the project's, written and checked as `charter.toml`'s `[sandbox].hosts` are. Read only while git leaves this file alone and never through a link, and **each host grants only once you confirmed it in Settings on this machine** (`app/sandbox.json` `hosts_mine`): adding it there confirms it, and a host the file holds that you did not add there (a chat's edit, a file from elsewhere) is listed "not yet confirmed", with Confirm. A sandboxed chat can write all of a clone's git state, so no check of git can tell your host from another's; the record is in the integrity class, which no sandboxed chat writes. Any other key of `[sandbox]` here (`mode`, `egress`) is refused with a sentence and read as absent: whether chats run sandboxed, and the presets, are the project's. Changed in Settings › Sandbox › Your hosts. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox/hosts.rs` `personal`; `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox.rs` `refusals` |

Your own dispatch limits on this machine, in the same shape and with the same refusals as `charter.toml`'s, **and never a dispatch grant**: `[dispatch.grants]` here is refused with a sentence and read as absent, since a grant of your own is kept by the app in `app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_mine` and the project's are in the committed file (#1437). **They only ever lower a limit**: a value above what the project's files give is ignored, and Settings › Project › Dispatch says so on its "Me on this machine" row. **Read even where git would carry this file**, which leaves every other table of it out: a lowering can only lower, so honouring it is the strict reading. An administrator's policy caps the result. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchlimits.rs` `Files::read`, `in_force` |
| `[chat_env].pass` | list[str] | optional, default `[]` | **purlis only** (ADR 0047, amendment of 2026-09-29). More of this machine's own environment every chat started in this plane is given, beyond the built-in keep-list and what the chat's harness declares (`crates/purlis-core/src/chatenv.rs` `PASSED`, `Harness::env_passed`). Each entry is a variable's name (letters, digits and `_`, not starting with a digit), or such a name ending in `*` for a prefix. A credential-class name (forge, cloud, model-provider or registry credential, or a name holding `KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD`) passes only by its exact name, never by a prefix. `OP_*`, a vault's declared identity variables, a harness's identity, `CHARTER_WORKSPACE`, `CHARTER_PLANE_ROOT_SESSION` and `TERM` are never passed, whatever is listed. An entry of another shape, a `pass` that is not a list, or another key in the table is refused with a sentence and passes nothing. No counterpart in `charter.toml`. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/chatenv.rs` `from_text`, `refusals`, `inherited` |

### `.charter/harness-profiles-launched.json`

- **Format:** JSON object, `{ "<profile name>": {"kind": str, "command": [str], "env": {str: str}} }`.
- **Status:** **stable** — it lives under `.charter/` and is written and read by *different*
  processes (a launch, a frame keypress under a hook, a `purlis reopen`), and it decides
  whether a command runs. It is not safe to delete in the "no consequence" sense: deleting it
  makes every declared profile ask for approval again (it fails towards asking, never towards
  running — `charter/profiletrust.py:129`).
- **Tier:** Clone state — the operator's consent to run a profile's command. Deleting it makes every profile ask again.
- **Written by:** `charter/profiletrust.py:155` `record_launched` — `config.replace_for`
  (atomic temp+rename, private 0600) of `json.dumps({**_read(), name: fingerprint}, indent=2) + "\n"`
  (`charter/profiletrust.py:172`). Triggered by approving a profile at the prompt
  (`charter/profiletrust.py:303`) and by a launch that runs one. **In purlis** (#430)
  it is written by `rewrite::replace` at `0600`, which also flushes the directory after the
  rename and **refuses a record that is a symlink** (Python's rename replaces the link); the
  consent is then not recorded, and the profile asks again.
- **Read by:** `charter/profiletrust.py:138` `_read` → `last_launched`
  (`charter/profiletrust.py:144`), `approval_needed` (`charter/profiletrust.py:195`),
  `refusal` (`charter/profiletrust.py:306`), the frame launcher and `purlis reopen`.
- **Git:** gitignored (inside `/.charter/`, `charter/commands.py:1096`).
- **Sandbox:** **a sandboxed chat never writes it** (ADR 0067 §5, the integrity class, #1458),
  under either name of the state folder and wherever the chat stands, so an approval recorded
  here is one the person gave. A chat may read it. Where the project's sandbox is off, or for a
  chat started without it, it is as writable as `charter.local.toml`.
- **Encoding details:** `indent=2`, trailing newline, `ensure_ascii` default (true); key order
  is insertion order of the existing document with an updated key keeping its position; `env`
  is a dict built from the already-sorted `Profile.env` pairs (`charter/profiletrust.py:126`).
  Whole-file read-modify-write with **no lock** — two concurrent approvals can lose one. Mode
  0600 and the directory 0700 via `config.private_mkdir`/`replace_for`
  (`charter/config.py:389`, `charter/config.py:595`).
  The fingerprint is **as declared, before `~` expansion** (`charter/profiletrust.py:121`).
  A built-in profile is never recorded and never asks (`charter/profiletrust.py:187`).

### `harnesses/<name>.toml` — a harness declaration

- **Format:** TOML, one file per harness, named after the harness it declares. **purlis
  only** ([ADR 0073](adr/0073-a-harness-is-declared-as-data-and-a-chat-runs-it-at-one-of-three-levels.md), FD-14).
  Hand-edited and committed.
- **Status:** **stable** — it is committed and travels to every clone, and it decides which
  program a chat runs.
- **Tier:** Plane — a harness this project runs that purlis does not ship, committed so every clone has it.
- **Written by:** nothing in purlis. The operator writes it, and every clone approves it
  before it runs (below). **A sandboxed chat never writes in `harnesses/`** (ADR 0067 §5, the
  later-code class, #1458): the folder at the project root is denied to its writes, so a
  declaration a person approves is one a person wrote or reviewed. A chat may read it. Where the
  project's sandbox is off, a chat can write one, and the approval below is what stands.
- **Read by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_declaration.rs` `read`, which every launch,
  `purlis harness list`, `purlis harness show <name>`, `purlis doctor` and the app's
  new-chat picker go through (`profiles::derive`). Each file is opened with no link on the
  way, must be a plain file of at most 64 KiB, and is read whole. A file whose name does not
  end `.toml` is not a declaration and is skipped.
- **Git:** committed.
- **What it gives:** a profile named after the harness, of `kind` `<name>`, running its
  `program` (`purlis harness list` shows it FROM `harnesses`), and a `kind` a profile in
  `charter.local.toml` may name. **A declared harness runs at level 1**: in its terminal, with
  none of purlis's hooks armed, because level 2 needs an adapter purlis ships (V24c). A
  project that turns the sandbox on does not start one, because nothing compiles a sandbox for
  a harness without an adapter yet (ADR 0067 §1, SD-2).
- **Approval:** a declared harness's program runs on this machine only after the operator
  approves the declaration, and again after any change to its bytes (V24b), recorded in
  [`.charter/harness-declarations-approved.json`](#charterharness-declarations-approvedjson).
  The new-chat picker asks, and **shows every word that will run** (V66): the profile's line,
  the declaration's file and whole digest, its program, and each template's words, escaped
  (`profiletrust::shown`), with a warning beside any word or value that names a file or folder at the project root. The approval records the digest of exactly what was shown: a
  declaration that changed between the dialog and the click is refused and nothing is
  recorded, and a launch reads the declarations once and judges and runs that one read, so a
  change between the check and the start is not what runs (`start::ready_in`). A profile in
  `charter.local.toml` of a declared kind asks for both its own command and the declaration.
- **Built-ins:** Claude Code (`claude`), opencode (`opencode`) and Codex (`codex`) are
  declarations in this format that purlis ships
  (`crates/purlis-core/src/harness_declaration/claude.toml`, `opencode.toml`, `codex.toml`),
  read by the same reader. They are not files in the project, and **a project never takes a
  built-in's name**: a built-in's declaration decides how its chats are armed (ADR 0073 §3).
  `purlis harness show <name>` prints any of them, under a comment line naming its file and
  digest. Each line is printed escaped, so where a file holds a byte outside printable ASCII
  the text printed is not the bytes the digest is of, and a second comment line says so.
- **Decided, not yet read:** a declaration in `charter.local.toml`, for this machine alone or
  replacing a built-in's (ADR 0073 §5, [#968](https://github.com/purlis/purlis/issues/968)).
- **Refusals:** a declaration purlis will not read gives no profile and is listed with the
  refused profiles, under its file, in one sentence. The first failure wins. Every key below
  is the whole schema: a key it does not list refuses the file.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | str | required | The word a profile's `kind` names. Letters, digits, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or digit, and the file's own name. Not a built-in's, and not the name purlis gives a harness it ships (`guardcmd::HARNESSES`: `claude-code`, `opencode`, `codex`, the word in `$PURLIS_HARNESS`), compared exactly, since a chat on it would be taken for that harness (#1119). | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_declaration.rs` `parse`, `read` |
| `title` | str | default `name` | What the operator calls it: the harness card's label, *What <title> can do here* (HP-19). **One line of at most 60 characters with no control, bidi or zero-width character**, and in a project's declaration never the title of a harness purlis ships (ignoring case). | stable | same, `MOST_TITLE`, `drawn_refusal` |
| `program` | str | required | **A bare program name found on `PATH`**: letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `+` and `-`, starting with a letter or digit, at most 128 characters. Never a path, `~`, a flag or a shell string. **Never a shell, an interpreter or a launcher** (`sh`, `bash`, `env`, `node`, `python3`, `npx`, `osascript`, `arch`, `xcrun`, `tmux`, `git`, `vim`, version managers such as `mise` and `pyenv`, and the like, matched without case; V66, V66c). A renamed or linked interpreter is not caught by its name; the approval dialog, which shows every word, is the control for that case. **Never a program of a harness purlis ships** either, which runs only armed, through its adapter. A profile in `charter.local.toml` can point a chat at a path on this machine. | stable | same, `bare_word`, `launcher` |
| `env` | list[str] | default `[]` | The harness's own environment namespace: a variable's name in capitals, digits and `_`, or a prefix ending `_*` (`AIDER_*`). Refused: anything reaching `CHARTER_*`; a name holding `KEY`/`TOKEN`/`SECRET`/`PASSWORD`; anything that could reach a credential family `chatenv::CREDENTIALS` lists (a forge's, a cloud's, a model provider's or a registry's: `AWS_*`, `GITHUB_*`, `OPENAI_*`, `ANTHROPIC_*`, `GEMINI_*`, …), in either direction of a prefix; and anything reaching what changes how a process loads, runs or finds programs (`LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PATH`, `GIT_*`, …). **Decided, not yet read** at launch: a chat on a declared harness is started with the built-in keep-list and `[chat_env] pass` until [#967](https://github.com/purlis/purlis/issues/967) passes it. | stable | same, `env_ok` |
| `tested` | str | optional | The harness versions these facts were measured on, as written; a fact on the harness card. TS1 settles what reads it. **One line of at most 80 characters with no control, bidi or zero-width character.** | stable | same, `MOST_TESTED` |
| `login` | str | optional | Where the operator logs in, said when a profile of this kind sets a variable named like a credential. | stable | same; `profiles::refusal` |
| `[session].chosen_by` | `"harness"` or `"purlis"` | default `"harness"` | Who chooses a new session's id. `"purlis"` needs `new` to hand over `{id}`; `"harness"` may not. | stable | same, `session` |
| `[session].new` | list[str] | default `[]` | The words that start a new session. **Every word after the program has an allowed shape** (V66c), here and in `resume` and `acp`: a flag, `-x` or `--name` (letters, digits and `-`); `--name=value` with a plain value (letters, digits and `-_.:,+`, no leading `.`, no drive letter such as `C:`, and no `%`, so no percent-encoded separator), where `{id}` and `{name}` may sit (`--session={id}`, `--title={name}`); or a subcommand, lowercase letters, digits and `-` with no dot (`exec`, `run`). A bare `{id}` or `{name}` word only in a built-in. Everything else is refused: a path anywhere, a bare relative filename, `@file`, a value glued to a short flag (`-I.`), a `VAR=value` assignment, shell syntax or a space, another placeholder. Every word, and every flag's value, is also checked against the shells, interpreters, launchers and built-in programs `program` refuses. **A residual the approval covers** (ruling of 2026-10-03): a value or a subcommand-shaped word can still name a file the program resolves in the chat's folder (`--cfg=rel.toml`); where it names a file or folder at the project root, the approval dialog says so beside it (*`--cfg=rel.toml` names the file rel.toml in this project; the program may read it*). | stable | same, `template`, `word_refusal` |
| `[session].resume` | list[str] | optional | The words that bring session `{id}` back; must name `{id}` (`--resume={id}`). The same shapes as `new`. | stable | same |
| `[session].named_by` | list[str] | default `[]` | The flags or subcommands by which the operator names a session in a profile's own command (`--resume`, or `--resume=<id>`), so purlis adds none of its own. | stable | same |
| `[terminal].newline` | str | optional | The bytes the harness reads as a new line in its input (ESC CR, `"\u001b\r"`). **One of the keys a terminal reads as a new line** (#1119): `"\r"`, `"\n"`, `"\r\n"`, `"\u001b\r"`, `"\\\r"` or `"\u001b[13;2u"` (Shift+Enter in the kitty keyboard encoding); anything else, and an empty string, is refused, because once wired it is typed into the program's terminal. Absent: the terminal's own Enter. **Decided, not yet read** for a declared harness ([#967](https://github.com/purlis/purlis/issues/967)). | stable | same, `terminal` |
| `[terminal].paste_drawn_whole` | inline table | optional | `{ lines = N, chars = N }`, the biggest paste it draws whole, each at least 1; a key left out has no limit. | stable | same |
| `[terminal].ready_to_type` | `"on-start"`, `"raw-and-quiet"` or `"never"` | default `"never"` | When a curation prompt may be typed into a new chat (ADR 0061). `"on-start"` waits for a hook, so only a harness with hooks may say it. | stable | same |
| `[levels].terminal` | bool | default `true` | Level 1. Every declaration offers it; `false` is refused. | stable | same |
| `[levels].hooks` | bool | default `false` | Level 2. `true` only in a built-in: a project declaration that says it is refused (V24c). | stable | same |
| `[levels].acp` | list[str] | optional | Level 3 over ACP: the argv that starts the harness's ACP agent. Its first word follows `program`'s rules and the rest `new`'s shapes. The built-in opencode declaration names `["opencode", "acp"]`, which HP-2's client (`purlis_core::acp`) runs; a chat starts at level 3 from a declaration once #1076 wires it in. | stable | same |
| `[capabilities].<name>` | str | optional | A harness capability (ADR 0073 §6): `"yes"`, `"no: <the reason>"` or `"unknown"`; the reason is drawn on the harness card, so it is **one line of at most 200 characters with no control, bidi or zero-width character**. One left out is unknown, which purlis treats as no. The names: `reports_its_process`, `reports_its_start_before_the_first_prompt`, `keeps_conversations_by_directory`, `reports_waiting`, `resumes_by_id` (`"yes"` needs `[session].resume`), `per_chat_plugins`. A ticket that reads a new one adds it here. | stable | same, `CAPABILITIES` |

### `.charter/harness-declarations-approved.json`

- **Format:** JSON object, `{ "<harness name>": {"digest": "sha256:<hex>"} }`. **purlis
  only** (ADR 0073 §5, V24b).
- **Status:** **stable** — it records an operator's consent to run a committed declaration's
  program on this clone, and it decides whether a chat starts.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the operator's consent to run a project's harness declaration on this clone. Deleting it makes every declaration ask again.
- **Written by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/profiletrust.rs` `approve`, from the new-chat
  picker's approval, through the same gated write as
  [`.charter/harness-profiles-launched.json`](#charterharness-profiles-launchedjson):
  `rewrite::replace` at `0600`, refusing a record that is a link or resolves outside the
  project.
- **Read by:** `profiletrust::declaration_approval_needed`, on every launch of a profile whose
  `kind` is a project's declaration, with the same gates as the profile record: no link on the
  way, a plain file, at most 1 MiB. Every unreadable state reads as "nothing approved".
- **Git:** gitignored (inside `/.charter/`).
- **Sandbox:** **a sandboxed chat never writes it** (ADR 0067 §5, the integrity class, #1458),
  as for the profile record above.
- **Encoding details:** the digest is of the declaration file's **bytes**, so any change to the
  file, a comment included, asks again. Kept apart from the profile record because that one is
  keyed by profile and records a command, which a declaration does not have (ADR 0073 §5).
  Read-modify-written whole with no lock, as the profile record is.

### `.charter/unattended-logins.json`

- **Format:** **decided, not yet written**
  ([ADR 0087](adr/0087-a-chats-model-is-one-choice-from-four-sources-and-charter-never-carries-a-harness-login.md) §3, SD-28).
  JSON object keyed by harness name, then by the login as the harness reports it, each holding
  when the operator acknowledged it. It holds no credential and no token.
- **Status:** **stable** — the operator's one-time acknowledgement that a harness's subscription
  login may run unattended (a trigger, a schedule, a workflow, a race, headless) in this project.
  Deleting it makes the next unattended `login` run ask again; it fails towards asking.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the operator's consent on this clone, like the profile record above.
- **Written by:** `purlisd`, from the operator's answer on a human scope (SD-28). Chats are
  denied it.
- **Git:** gitignored (inside `/.charter/`).

---

### `.gitignore` (plane root)

- **Format:** plain text, line-oriented, append-only from purlis's side.
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, hand-edited, and it carries two literal anchors other
  purlis code depends on.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:**
  - `charter/commands.py:1116` `_ensure_gitignore` (from `cmd_init`): writes
    `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE` verbatim when the file is absent (`charter/commands.py:1129`),
    otherwise appends only the missing whole lines through the one shared appender.
  - `charter/util.py:472` `append_gitignore` — the single writer for additions. It appends
    `"\n\n"`-separated: existing body `rstrip("\n") + "\n\n"`, then `# <header>\n`, then one
    line each (`charter/util.py:499`). Headers seen: ``added by `purlis init` ``
    (`charter/commands.py:1152`), ``added by `purlis guard --local` ``
    (`charter/commands.py:1792`), ``added by `purlis reinit` — harness profiles stay on this machine``
    (`charter/commands.py:1821`), ``added by `purlis browser install` `` (`charter/browser.py:173`).
  - `charter/workspace.py:1408` `_write_live_block` rewrites the managed live-workspace block
    (markers `charter/workspace.py:1338`, `charter/workspace.py:1339`) — **workspaces area**,
    noted here only because it splices at the `!/workspaces/.gitkeep` anchor.
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:1346` `live_workspaces`, the presence checks in
  `charter/commands.py:1134`, `charter/util.py:494`, plus git itself (the real consumer).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** the baseline is a fixed here-doc (`charter/commands.py:1087`–`:1113`),
  comments included, and the exact lines matter:
  - `/workspaces/*/*` (`charter/commands.py:1091`) and `!/workspaces/.gitkeep`
    (`charter/commands.py:1092`) — the second is the **literal anchor**
    `workspace.set_live` splices the managed block after (`charter/workspace.py:1414`).
  - `/.charter/` (`charter/commands.py:1096`)
  - `/.claude/settings.local.json` (`charter/commands.py:1100`, constant at
    `charter/commands.py:1771`)
  - `/charter.local.toml` (`charter/commands.py:1104`, constant at `charter/commands.py:1803`)
  - `/sessions/` — **purlis only** (ADR 0064): the plane root's session records stay on
    this machine. In the baseline under its own comment, added by `init` when missing, and by
    `reinit` under ``added by `purlis reinit` — the plane root's session records stay on this
    machine``. Deleting the line shares them.
  - `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `.venv/`, `.DS_Store` (`charter/commands.py:1107`–`:1112`)
  - Presence detection is **whole-line, stripped**, except `.charter/` which is a substring
    test on the body (`charter/commands.py:1136`) — both quirks are deliberate and recorded.
  - Plain `write_text`; no atomic write, no lock. **In purlis** (#358) every write of
    the plane's `.gitignore` (`init`, `reinit`, the LIVE block) is a temp file beside it and
    one rename, under the same `flock` on the plane root as `charter.toml`; a `.gitignore`
    that cannot be read as UTF-8 text is refused rather than rewritten from nothing. The
    same holds for `.gitattributes`.

---

### `.gitattributes` (plane root)

- **Format:** git attributes, line-oriented, inside a managed block with the markers
  `# >>> charter merge rules (managed by charter) >>>` and `# <<< charter merge rules <<<`,
  or, in a project migrated to purlis names (its manifest is `purlis.toml`, or it requires
  `purlis-names`), `# >>> purlis merge rules (managed by purlis) >>>` and
  `# <<< purlis merge rules <<<`. Either pair is read as the block, and the block is rewritten
  in place under the pair the project writes, never left beside a second one (V93g, V93i).
  Lines outside the block are the operator's own.
- **Status:** **stable**. It is committed, and git reads it.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** purlis's `init` and `reinit`, through
  `crates/purlis-core/src/scaffold/mod.rs` `ensure_gitattributes` (purlis#295, ADR 0051):
  the block is replaced where it is, or added at the end, and every other line is kept.
- **Read by:** git, on every merge and rebase a save makes.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** the block holds exactly these lines, in this order. Each names a file
  that only ever grows by whole lines, so git's `union` driver keeps both sides of a conflict:

  ```
  personas/_dispatch/*.jsonl merge=union
  personas/_skills/*.jsonl merge=union
  workspaces/*/pieces/*.jsonl merge=union
  workspaces/*/changes/log/*.jsonl merge=union
  workspaces/*/work/*.jsonl merge=union
  personas/*/memory/MEMORY.md merge=union
  workspaces/*/memory/MEMORY.md merge=union
  ```

  Any other conflict leaves the plane **blocked** (ADR 0051).

---

### Baseline directories: `personas/`, `inventory/`, `workspaces/`

- **Tier:** Plane — committed (through `.gitkeep` where empty).
- **Format:** directories. **Status: stable** — `instance.drift` reports their absence and
  `purlis reinit` heals it, and their names are part of the layout a second implementation
  must resolve.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:2907` `_create_baseline_dirs` (shared by `cmd_init`
  `charter/commands.py:2685` and `cmd_reinit` `charter/commands.py:2934`) over
  `instance.BASELINE_DIRS` (`charter/instance.py:504`). Plain `mkdir(parents=True,
  exist_ok=True)`, never tightened (they are committed content). A baseline path occupied by a
  **file** is reported as blocked and the command exits 1 — purlis never deletes or renames.
- **Read by:** `charter/instance.py:507` `drift`, `charter/doctor.py:441`
  `check_control_plane_schema`, and every consumer of `PERSONAS_DIR`/`WORKSPACES_DIR`/`INVENTORY`.
- **Git:** committed (empty dirs are not, in practice — note below).
- **Defect worth recording:** nothing creates `workspaces/.gitkeep`, although the baseline
  `.gitignore` names it as a negation and as the splice anchor (`charter/commands.py:1092`).
  Measured on a fresh `purlis init`: `workspaces/` is created empty and no `.gitkeep` is
  written, so an empty `workspaces/` does not survive a clone. Only
  `personas/<front-door>/{memory,refs}/.gitkeep` is written (`charter/commands.py:2680`).
  **Fixed in purlis** (#355): `init` and `reinit` create an empty `workspaces/.gitkeep`
  when it is absent, and never truncate one that is there. It is reported as part of
  `workspaces/`, or on its own (`+ workspaces/.gitkeep`) when `workspaces/` already existed.

---

### `personas/<front-door>/` (what `purlis init` scaffolds at the plane root)

- **Status:** **stable** (committed). The persona file *format* is the personas area's; what
  belongs here is only that `init` creates it and declares it.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:2651` `_ensure_front_door`, called from `cmd_init`.
  Default name `steward` (`charter/cli.py:114`), `--front-door NAME` renames it,
  `--no-front-door` suppresses it (`charter/cli.py:117`).
  - Skipped entirely if the plane already has **any** persona (`personas/*/persona.md` or the
    legacy `personas/*.md`) or if `[persona] default` is already declared
    (`charter/commands.py:2669`).
  - Writes `personas/<name>/persona.md` from the `_FRONT_DOOR` template
    (`charter/commands.py:2597`), with `{name}` and a title-cased `{role}` derived from the
    name (`-`/`_` → space, `.title()`), then `memory/.gitkeep` and `refs/.gitkeep`
    (`charter/commands.py:2680`), then `instance.set_default_persona`
    (`charter/commands.py:2681`).
- **Git:** committed.

---

### `inventory/repos.json`

- **Format:** JSON object.
- **Status:** **stable** — tracked in git, shared across machines, and read by commands,
  `doctor` and the status line.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/inventory.py:292` `save` (only writer), called from
  `charter/commands.py:172` (`purlis discover`). **The Rust purlis only adds to it**
  (ADR 0055): `inventory::add` merges records into what the file lists, `discover` keeps every
  listed repo its run did not see unless an `exclude` names it, and the app's repo picker adds
  the repos it clones that the file does not list yet, leaving listed records as they are. The
  Python replaced the whole list on every `discover`.
- **Read by:** `charter/inventory.py:71` `load` → `charter/inventory.py:173` `repos`
  (`charter/commands.py:218`, `:366`, `:641`, `:880`; `charter/statusline.py:792`;
  `charter/doctor.py:3674`), and `charter/inventory.py:265` `find`.
- **Git:** committed (nothing ignores `inventory/`).
- **Encoding details:** `json.dumps(doc, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False) + "\n"` via
  `write_text` (`charter/inventory.py:315`) — not atomic, no lock; the parent directory is
  created first (`charter/inventory.py:314`). Records are **sorted by `name`**
  (`charter/inventory.py:304`), and `merge` sorts the same way
  (`charter/inventory.py:262`). Deliberately **no generated-at timestamp**
  (`charter/inventory.py:295`). Records whose `source` is `"plane"` are stripped before
  writing (`charter/inventory.py:303`, `charter/inventory.py:81`) — the plane's own repo is
  derived at read time from `git remote get-url origin` (`charter/inventory.py:97`), never
  persisted. Key order is the literal dict order below.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |

### `docs/topology.md`

- **Format:** Markdown, fully generated.
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, and written by one process to be read by people (and by
  anything regenerating it: a byte-different render is a spurious diff).
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:224` (`purlis docs` / `purlis docs generate`, and the
  tail of `purlis discover` unless `--no-docs`), body from `charter/render.py:43`
  `topology_md`; `DOCS_DIR` is created first (`charter/commands.py:223`). Refuses to write at
  all when the inventory is empty (`charter/commands.py:219`).
- **Read by:** people; `purlis status` points at it (`charter/commands.py:918`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** `render.topology_md(doc) + "\n"` — the renderer already ends with an
  empty element, so the file ends with a blank line then newline. Fixed structure
  (`charter/render.py:45`–`charter/render.py:63`): the `BANNER` comment
  (`charter/render.py:7`), `# Repository Topology`, a count line
  `**N repos** in the `<group>` <label>.`, a blockquote, then a 5-column table
  (`| Repo | Kind | Stack | Branch | Description |`) with one row per repo **sorted by name**
  (`charter/render.py:44`). `<label>` is `"GitLab group"`/`"GitHub org"` only when every record
  agrees on one forge kind, else the neutral `"group"` (`charter/render.py:26`). Cells escape
  `|` and flatten newlines (`charter/render.py:17`). No timestamp anywhere.

---

### `README.md` — the generated persona roster block

- **Format:** Markdown block spliced into a hand-written file between two literal markers.
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, and the markers are a contract with a hand-written file.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:331` `refresh_readme_personas`, called from
  `purlis docs` (`charter/commands.py:229`); body from `charter/render.py:76` `personas_md`,
  splice by `charter/render.py:149` `splice_personas`. Plain `write_text`
  (`charter/commands.py:356`), only when the result differs.
- **Read by:** people. The markers are `<!-- BEGIN personas — GENERATED by `charter docs`; do
  not edit by hand. -->` (`GENERATED by `purlis docs`` in a project migrated to purlis names;
  either is found, and the block is written under the project's; V93g, V93i) and
  `<!-- END personas -->`
  (`charter/render.py:14`); **absent markers mean purlis writes nothing**
  (`charter/render.py:154`), which is the case on purlis's own plane today.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** rows sorted by `(-dispatches, name)` (`charter/render.py:99`), a
  12-cell unicode bar (`charter/render.py:68`), and a `⚑` legend only when a flag appears.
  The counts come from the committed dispatch log's tally and each persona's memory
  directory — the **personas area** owns those. **purlis words it as what it is (#1460):**
  the headline says how many dispatches to a persona the committed log holds, all from before
  a persona ran as its own chat, and that `persona stats` counts the ones since from each
  machine's own records, which this committed block never reads. The Python's mermaid pie of
  dispatches to a persona against a generic agent is not drawn: a helper is no dispatch now,
  and the log stopped receiving either row. `⚑` marks a persona the log holds no dispatch to.

### `purlis browser install` — three more plane-root paths

`purlis browser` installs a vendor CLI into the plane, and a plane reader meets its
directories at the root. None is purlis's own format; all three are named because an
enumerator that does not expect them has to guess.

- **Tier:** None — the vendor CLI's files, not purlis's; `.playwright-cli/` is gitignored output the vendor rewrites.
- **`.claude/skills/playwright-cli/`** (`SKILL_DIR`, `charter/browser.py:79`) — the pages the
  vendor's generator writes, read by Claude Code as project skills. **stable** in the sense
  that matters here: a harness reads it. Written by the generator, not by purlis.
- **`.playwright/`** (`CONFIG_DIR`, `charter/browser.py:96`) — created by `install` itself
  (`initWorkspace`), holding `.playwright/cli.config.json`. Project configuration. purlis
  deliberately says nothing about whether a plane commits it (ADR 0017), and writes no
  `.gitignore` line for it.
- **`.playwright-cli/`** (`OUTPUT_DIR`, `charter/browser.py:90`) — the vendor's output
  directory: traces under `.playwright-cli/trace`, plus snapshots, screenshots and PDFs.
  Created when something is written there, never by `install`. purlis **does** append
  `.playwright-cli/` to the plane's `.gitignore` (`ensure_output_ignored`,
  `charter/browser.py:151`, header at `charter/browser.py:173`) because a trace carries
  authenticated network traffic — the one of the three purlis takes a position on.

### Plane-root files that exist but are **not** this area

Named so the assembled doc does not lose them: `vaults.json` (committed shared vault registry,
`charter/config.py:774` — vaults area), `.claude/settings.json` and `opencode.json` at the
plane root (written by `purlis init`'s harness wiring — `charter/commands.py:2296`,
`charter/commands.py:2321`, `charter/commands.py:2098`, `charter/commands.py:1233` — harness
area), `workspaces/*` (workspaces area), `personas/*` internals (personas area),
`.charter/*` other than the profile launch record (runtime-state areas). The plane's own
`.claude/skills/**`, `.opencode/agent/**` and `.codex/skills/**` are committed plane content
that purlis copies into a clone rather than authors; they are described where that mirror is
(`charter/harness/claude_code.py:53`).

---

## Workspaces

Everything Python charter reads or writes under `workspaces/`, plus the three places
outside it that decide or record a workspace's state: the plane's `.gitignore` managed
block, the guest checkouts' `.git/info/exclude` block, and the `.charter/` pointers.

All citations are against the clone at commit `50d31dc`.

Two rules hold for the whole area and are not repeated per file:

- **Name rule.** A workspace name is `instance.workspace_name_ok` — `contain.segment_ok`
  plus `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$` (`charter/instance.py:181`, `charter/instance.py:199`),
  asked through `workspace.valid_name` (`charter/workspace.py:211`). Every name read off
  disk is re-checked before it is joined onto a path.
- **Writer helpers.** `config.write_for` (`charter/config.py:504`) writes whole,
  `config.replace_for` (`charter/config.py:595`) writes atomically through a temp named
  `<target>.<pid>.<12 random hex>.tmp` (`charter/config.py:592`, `TEMP_SUFFIX = ".tmp"` at
  `charter/config.py:552`), `config.create_for` (`charter/config.py:517`) creates with
  `O_EXCL` only where nothing is at the name. Files under `.charter/` come out 0600/0700
  (`config.private_mkdir`, `charter/config.py:190`); files inside `workspaces/` keep the umask's mode, because `write_for` dispatches on where the
  path is (`charter/config.py:504`).

---

### `workspaces/`

- **Format:** directory.
- **Status:** stable — the operator's clones live here, and the plane's `.gitignore` names
  it literally.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL — `workspaces/.gitkeep` is committed; what is inside follows each workspace's LIVE or LOCAL.
- **Written by:** `purlis init` (`charter/commands.py:1091` writes `/workspaces/*/*` and
  `!/workspaces/.gitkeep` into `.gitignore`); the directory itself by
  `workspace.ensure` → `wd.mkdir(parents=True)` (`charter/workspace.py:1313`).
- **Read by:** `workspace.read_workspaces` (`charter/workspace.py:914`),
  `workspace.legacy_flat_clones` (`charter/workspace.py:1290`), `gitpolicy.scan` via
  `charter/commands.py:3268`.
- **Git:** the directory is committed only through `workspaces/.gitkeep`; everything two
  levels down is ignored by `/workspaces/*/*` unless the LIVE block un-ignores it.
- **Encoding details:** a one-time migration renames a legacy `repos/` to `workspaces/`
  (`workspace._ensure_layout`, `charter/workspace.py:53`). An entry whose name starts with
  `.` is never a workspace (`charter/workspace.py:926`); an entry that is itself a clone
  (a `.git` directory) is not a workspace either (`charter/workspace.py:928`).
  `purlis init` does **not** create `workspaces/default/` — the first command that puts
  something in it does; the name is always listable anyway (`charter/commands_workspace.py:116`).

### `workspaces/.default`

- **Format:** plain text — one workspace name, `\n`-terminated.
- **Status:** stable — committed (the default ignore rule `/workspaces/*/*` does not match
  a file directly under `workspaces/`, `charter/workspace.py:508`), hand-editable, and read
  by every process that resolves a workspace.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `workspace.set_declared_default` (`charter/workspace.py:512`, through
  `contain.writable`), from `purlis workspace default <name>`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:669`). Removed by `workspace.clear_declared_default`
  (`charter/workspace.py:524`) for `--clear`.
- **Read by:** `workspace.declared_default` (`charter/workspace.py:487`), which is a rung of
  `workspace.chosen` (`charter/workspace.py:646`) and of `workspace.source`
  (`charter/workspace.py:676`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** exactly `name + "\n"` (`charter/workspace.py:512`). On read the
  value is `.strip()`ed and re-checked with `valid_name`; a `contain.file_refusal` (symlink,
  FIFO, oversized) makes it read as absent (`charter/workspace.py:488`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/`

- **Format:** directory.
- **Status:** stable — it *is* the workspace.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL — a LIVE workspace's charter, memory, todos, sessions and changes are committed; a LOCAL one's stay in this clone and are backed up as clone state (FR-10).
- **Written by:** `workspace.ensure` (`charter/workspace.py:1313`), which then calls
  `scaffold` best-effort (`charter/workspace.py:1315`). Reached from `workspace create`,
  `workspace use`, `purlis clone` (`charter/commands.py:385`), `restore`, `fork`, and every
  frame launch.
- **Read by:** everything in this area.
- **Git:** the directory entry is ignored by `/workspaces/*/*`.
- **Encoding details:** `scaffold` refuses the whole directory when it does not resolve
  inside `workspaces/` (`charter/workspace.py:1840`). Baseline creation order is
  memory → refs → workspace.md → workspace.json → harness layer → structure stamp
  (`charter/workspace.py:1851`–`1885`), each path skipped when `_baseline_answers` says it
  cannot be checked or something is in the way (`charter/workspace.py:1849`).
- **Its four stores, `memory/`, `todos/`, `sessions/` and `changes/`, are written with no link on
  the way (V74, #1064).** Every writer, purlis's MCP tools, the `purlis` commands and the window
  alike, and every reader except those #1083 still tracks, opens `workspaces`, the workspace and
  the store one directory at a time without following a link, and then uses each file through the
  directory it holds, never by its path. A store, or a file or directory in one, that is a link is
  never followed by them, even when it lands inside the project's data directories: a write that
  would go through it is refused and writes nothing, and a reader leaves the entry out. A link
  that leaves the project is refused in the words it always was. A path below `workspaces/` that
  does not name `<ws>/<store>` plainly (a `..` in it, say) is refused rather than used by path.
  The MCP tools refuse a store holding any link whole; a command leaves such an entry out and goes
  on, so a link a chat plants cannot stop the operator recording a todo. The commands and the
  window wait a few seconds at most for a store's lock: one a chat keeps is answered with a
  refusal, not a command that never returns. The readers #1083 tracks (the doctor's memory rows,
  the persona and briefing counts, and the landing and pending logs) still open what they list by
  path, under the containment rule. On a platform without directory descriptors (Windows) the MCP
  tools are not offered, and the commands and the window reach the stores by path: a link that
  leaves the project's data directories is refused there, and one that stays is followed.

### `workspaces/<ws>/workspace.md` — the living charter

- **Format:** Markdown; purlis parses and rewrites `## ` sections, no frontmatter.
- **Status:** stable — hand-edited, committed for a LIVE workspace, read by the SessionStart
  digest, the status line/tab strip (vision cell) and `handoff`.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Written by:** `workspace.scaffold_charter` (`charter/workspace.py:4360`, template at
  `charter/workspace.py:4295`) and `workspace.set_vision` (`charter/workspace.py:4370`);
  commands `workspace create --vision`, `workspace vision "…"`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1613`). Copied wholesale by `fork`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1689`). **In purlis, also a project template** (FR-17,
  `Workspace::seed_sections`): when the first run takes a repo into a workspace, each `## `
  section of the template's starter replaces the same section while that section still holds
  exactly what purlis's own template (above) first wrote there; today the starters have
  only `## Context & decisions`. A section with anything else in it is left as it is.
- **Read by:** `workspace.read_charter` (`charter/workspace.py:4373`), `read_vision`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4441`), `_vision_cell` (`charter/commands_workspace.py:64`),
  `last_active` (`charter/workspace.py:4421`).
- **Git:** gitignored unless LIVE (`!/workspaces/<ws>/workspace.md`,
  `charter/workspace.py:1397`).
- **Encoding details:**
  - Created only when absent, with `config.create_for` (`charter/workspace.py:4360`); a
    file that exists is never overwritten, only its `## Vision` body replaced.
  - Template: `# <name>`, a 4-line block quote, then `## Vision`, `## Context & decisions`,
    `## Glossary`, `## Log` (`charter/workspace.py:4295`–`4323`). **purlis adds
    `## Sessions` before `## Log`** (ADR 0064), whose body is
    `_No session records yet — a chat's Smart close writes one, and purlis keeps this line
    pointing at them._` until the first record.
  - `## Sessions` is **purlis's one line**, rewritten through the section replacement below
    every time a record is written (`sessionrecord::point`): `<N> session record(s) — the
    latest is [<title>](sessions/<file>) (<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>); all of them, newest first, in
    [sessions/index.md](sessions/index.md).` A file without the section gets it appended. The
    other sections are the operator's and the smart-close skill's. The unset vision body is
    the placeholder at `charter/workspace.py:4290` (`_Not set yet — …`).
  - Section replacement: `_replace_md_section` (`charter/workspace.py:4326`) keeps the
    `## <header>` line, replaces everything to the next line starting `"## "` or EOF with
    `"", body.strip(), ""`, rstrips the file and adds one trailing `\n`; a missing section is
    appended as `\n## <header>\n\n<body>\n`. The header match is
    `^##\s+Vision\s*$`, case-insensitive (`charter/workspace.py:4332`).
  - Vision extraction: `^##\s+Vision\s*$(.*?)(?=^##\s|\Z)` with `MULTILINE|DOTALL`, body
    stripped, and a body starting `_Not set yet` reads as unset
    (`charter/workspace.py:4441`–`4444`).
  - Reads are refused (`""`) when the *directory* or the file fails containment
    (`charter/workspace.py:4391`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/workspace.json` — the committed manifest

- **Format:** JSON object, `json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/workspace.py:1612`).
- **Status:** stable — committed for LIVE workspaces, restored on other machines, and
  hand-editable (`manifest_owner` exists precisely to tell purlis's copy from a hand's).
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Written by:** `workspace._write_manifest` (`charter/workspace.py:1589`) via
  `write_manifest` (`charter/workspace.py:1577`, the deliberate writer: `snapshot`, `fork`,
  `rename`), `scaffold_manifest` (`charter/workspace.py:1652`, birth) and `record_members`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1684`, a clone landing — `charter/commands.py:477`).
  Commands: `workspace create`/`use`/`clone` (through `ensure`),
  `workspace snapshot` (`charter/commands_workspace.py:942`),
  `workspace fork` (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1719`),
  `workspace rename` (`charter/workspace.py:1488`; in purlis `wscmd::rename`, which
  rewrites `name` and keeps the owner: a manifest purlis stamped is stamped again, one a hand
  wrote stays unstamped),
  `workspace reinit` (backfill, `charter/workspace.py:4645`).
  **In charter-app, also the Settings tab's Workspace level** (`purlis_core::settings::workspace`,
  charter-app#280, NO-7 #1232): a setting's change to `settings` (`save`), or the whole text
  from its Edit as JSON link (`save_text`). Both refuse to write over a manifest that changed on
  disk since the tab read it, refuse what the settings readers would refuse that the manifest did
  not already hold, and refuse a value `secretshape` calls a credential; Edit as JSON also refuses
  text that is not a JSON object. Neither changes who owns the manifest: one a hand wrote is
  written unstamped (Edit as JSON's text byte for byte), and one charter wrote, or a first one,
  is stamped again.
  **Edit as JSON also refuses** a `name` other than the workspace's folder, and `repos` that is
  not a list of `{"name": …}` records, unless the file already held that exact value
  (`settings::workspace::manifest_refusals`, #1292). A row's `branch`, where there is one, must
  be a name git would take as a branch's (`git check-ref-format --branch`): not starting with
  `-`, not `@`, not a full `refs/…` name. `HEAD` is let through, since `snapshot` records it for a
  repo with no branch checked out.
- **The workspace's lock** (#1292): every purlis writer of `workspace.json` (the Settings
  tab's two saves, clone and drop, snapshot, fork, rename, and the scaffold that birth and
  reinit write) takes the lock on the workspace's directory (`Workspace::manifest_lock`,
  `rewrite::Lock`) before it reads the manifest, and holds it until the write, so two writers at
  once never lose each other's change. The folder is checked again once the lock is held: if a
  `workspace rename` or a removal took it away while the writer waited, the writer refuses
  rather than make `workspaces/<old>` again. A workspace folder that is a link to another
  folder is refused by every writer, in a sentence of its own; purlis never follows the link.
- **Read by:** `workspace.read_manifest` (`charter/workspace.py:1500`), `manifest_owner`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1556`), `restore` (`charter/commands_workspace.py:955`), `fork`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1709`), `merge_repo_rows` (`charter/workspace.py:1739`),
  `last_active` (`charter/workspace.py:4421`). In purlis, its `settings` are read by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` (`Choices::read_in`) for Settings at the
  Workspace level, the window's filter on extension panels and views for the focused workspace, and
  the executor's gate for a view on that workspace's strip (purlis#280); by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` (`Choices::read_in`) for Settings at the Workspace
  level and for every chat started in the workspace (purlis#282); and its `settings.theme`
  by `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` (`Said::read_in`, `colour_of`) for
  Settings at the Workspace level, the theme the window draws while the workspace is in front, and
  every workspace tab's colour (purlis#281).
- **Git:** gitignored unless LIVE (`!/workspaces/<ws>/workspace.json`,
  `charter/workspace.py:1397`); it is the first path of the managed block.
- **Encoding details:**
  - Atomic: `config.replace_for` through a pid+random temp beside the file
    (`charter/workspace.py:1612`), path first run through `contain.writable`
    (`charter/workspace.py:1609`), which **raises** on a symlink out of the plane.
    **In purlis** (#430) through `rewrite::replace`: the file keeps the mode it has
    (Python's comes back at the umask's), a read-only one and one that is itself a symlink
    are refused, and the directory is flushed after the rename.
  - Key order is insertion order of the dict the writer built, with `charter_generated`
    appended last (`charter/workspace.py:1611`). The birth document's order is
    `name, description, repos, updated_at, updated_by` (`charter/workspace.py:1677`);
    `snapshot` and `fork` mutate a read document, so a manifest that already existed keeps
    the order it had on disk, and `fork` inserts `forked_from` after `name`
    (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1713`–`1718`).
  - `repos` rows are sorted by name whenever purlis adds one
    (`charter/workspace.py:1729`); `snapshot` writes them in `clones()` order, which is
    already sorted (`charter/workspace.py:1248`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | required; the workspace's own name | identity; rewritten by `rename` | stable | `charter/workspace.py:1677`, `charter/workspace.py:1487` |
| `description` | string | `""` | free text, set by `snapshot --description` | stable | `charter/commands_workspace.py:937` |
| `repos` | list of objects | `[]` | membership, and optionally pinned branches | stable | `charter/workspace.py:1677` |
| `repos[].name` | string | required | clone directory name under the workspace; untrusted, gated by `contain.child` on restore | stable | `charter/workspace.py:1649`, `charter/commands_workspace.py:985` |
| `repos[].branch` | string | **absent** for every row purlis writes itself; set by `snapshot` | the branch `restore` checks out; a row without one restores at the default branch | stable | `charter/commands_workspace.py:939`, `charter/commands_workspace.py:1014` |
| `updated_at` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601, `timespec="seconds"`, e.g. `2026-09-17T14:01:35+00:00` | stable | `charter/workspace.py:1616`, `charter/commands_workspace.py:940` |
| `updated_by` | string | required | `$USER` or `"unknown"` for automatic writes (`charter/workspace.py:1633`); `git config user.name` for `snapshot`/`fork` (`charter/commands_workspace.py:860`) | stable | `charter/workspace.py:1679` |
| `forked_from` | string | present only on a fork | the source workspace | stable | `charter/commands_workspace.py:1714` |
| `settings` | object | **absent** in every manifest written before purlis#280, and in one whose workspace sets nothing; absent = the project's answer | **purlis only** (purlis#280, ADR 0048). The workspace's layer of the project's settings, read between `charter.toml` and `charter.local.toml`. Its keys mirror those files' tables — see [`settings`](#settings--a-workspaces-layer) below. Every writer keeps it: `snapshot`, `fork` (which inherits it) and a clone's `record_members` mutate the document they read. | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/settings/workspace.rs` |
| `charter_generated` | string | written on every purlis write | sha256 of the rest of the document, canonically serialised. In a project migrated to purlis names the key is `purlis_generated`, and a stamp renames `charter_generated` in place; either is read, `purlis_generated` first (V93g, V93i) | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/manifest.rs` |

**`charter_generated` computation** (a Rust writer must match it byte for byte), the same over
either key name, so a digest moved to `purlis_generated` still matches:
`sha256(json.dumps({k: v for k, v in doc.items() if k not in ("purlis_generated", "charter_generated")}, sort_keys=True).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()`
— body at `charter/workspace.py:1540`, digest at `charter/workspace.py:1945`. Note
`sort_keys=True` and Python's default separators (`", "`, `": "`) for the *digest* input,
while the file on disk is `indent=2` in insertion order. Ownership: a document whose
stamp matches is `"charter"` (the `purlis_generated` one when both keys are there); anything else present is `"operator"` and the
automatic writers leave it byte for byte alone; absent is `"absent"`
(`charter/workspace.py:1556`–`1574`). A present-but-unparseable file is `"operator"`.

#### `settings` — a workspace's layer

**purlis only** (purlis#280, ADR 0048). A workspace refines its project for the team:
for each key, the order is this machine's approval, then `charter.toml` (Shared), then this
object, then `charter.local.toml` (Local). A workspace's settings are committed with the
manifest when the workspace is LIVE, and stay on this machine when it is not. Old manifests
have no `settings` and read exactly as before: the project's answer.

The object mirrors the TOML files' tables, so one reader reads all three: JSON `true`/`false`
is a TOML bool, a string is a string, an object is a table. **`null` reads as not set**, so the
next layer down answers.

| Key | Type | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `settings.extensions.<id>.enabled` | bool | Whether this workspace has the extension on, over `charter.toml`'s `[extensions.<id>] enabled` and under `charter.local.toml`'s. It cannot reach past this machine's approval. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve` |
| `settings.extensions.<id>.settings.<key>` | bool or str | A value for a setting the extension declares, over Shared's and under Local's, key by key. A value it would not accept is ignored with a sentence and the next layer down is used. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `resolve` |
| any other key in `settings.extensions.<id>` | — | Refused by the Workspace level's save, and ignored by the reader, in the words it refuses `[extensions]` in a TOML file. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project.rs` `refusals_in` |
| `settings.harness_plugins.<harness>."<plugin id>"` | bool | **charter-app#282, ADR 0050.** Whether the chats purlis starts in this workspace have that harness plugin on or off, over `charter.toml`'s `[harness_plugins.<harness>]` and under `charter.local.toml`'s, plugin by plugin. A chat is in the workspace when its directory is under `workspaces/<ws>/`. Everything the TOML key says holds here: only a plugin this machine has installed is handed on, Codex and opencode show it as *not supported yet* and hand it to nothing, and `charter-app@inline` cannot be `false` nor `charter@charter` `true` under `claude`. | `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` `resolve`, `for_start` |
| any other shape under `settings.harness_plugins` | — | Refused by the Workspace level's save, and ignored by the reader, in the words it refuses `[harness_plugins]` in a TOML file, with the key named at `settings.harness_plugins…`. | `crates/purlis-core/src/harness_plugin.rs` `refusals_in` |
| `settings.theme.use` | str | The theme the window and its terminals draw while this workspace is in front (purlis#281): the same values as `charter.toml`'s `[theme].use`, over it and under `charter.local.toml`'s. An extension's theme is drawn only while that extension is on in this workspace, so a workspace that turns it off draws the built-in `charter-dark` and says why. A value of none of the shapes is ignored with a sentence and the next layer down is used. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve` |
| `settings.theme.icons` | str | The icon theme the file trees draw while this workspace is in front (FM-3, #1106): the same values as `charter.toml`'s `[theme].icons`, over it and under `charter.local.toml`'s. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve_icons` |
| `settings.theme.colour` | str | The workspace's colour (purlis#281): one of `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, or `#rrggbb`, whose hue is taken. **A workspace's alone**: the project's files cannot set one, and no other layer overrides it. It picks no theme; the window tints the accent, the focus ring and this workspace's tab and chat strip shades of the theme it draws with the hue, at the same luminance, and leaves text and the terminal as they are. Any other value is ignored with a sentence, and the workspace has no colour. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `resolve`, `colour_of`; the tint, `app/src/theme/tint.ts` |
| any other key in `settings.theme`, or `settings.theme` that is not an object | — | Refused by the Workspace level's save, and ignored by the reader: a workspace's theme holds `use`, `icons` and `colour`. | `crates/purlis-core/src/extension/project/theme.rs` `refusals_in_workspace` |
| any other key in `settings`, or `settings` that is not an object | — | Refused by the save, and ignored by the reader: a workspace's settings hold `extensions`, `harness_plugins` and `theme` and nothing else. | `crates/purlis-core/src/settings/workspace.rs` `refusals` |

**Written by** Settings at the Workspace level (`settings::workspace::save`, SE-20), which changes only
`settings`: every other key keeps its place and value, a key removed takes every object it
leaves empty with it (so removing the last setting gives the manifest back as it was), and the
`settings` key itself keeps its place. **It keeps the manifest's owner**: a manifest purlis
wrote is stamped again (`charter_generated`), one a hand wrote is written unstamped, so the
automatic writers keep leaving it alone. A workspace with no manifest gets the one
`scaffold_manifest` would write, with the settings in it. The save is refused when the file
changed since the tab read it, for what the reader would refuse (what the file already held
excepted), and for a secret-shaped value, named by its kind.

### `workspaces/<ws>/memory/` — the task journal

- **Format:** directory of Markdown files plus a `MEMORY.md` index.
- **Status:** stable — committed for LIVE workspaces, hand-editable, read by the SessionStart
  briefing, `purlis recall`, `doctor` and `curate`.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Written by:** `workspace.scaffold_memory` (`charter/workspace.py:1817`) →
  `memstore.ensure_index` (`charter/memstore.py:86`); `workspace.remember`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4231`) → `memstore.write` (`charter/memstore.py:101`);
  `workspace.forget_memory` (`charter/workspace.py:4257`) → `memstore.forget`
  (`charter/memstore.py:452`); `curate.apply_safe` via `workspace optimize`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:724`); `memstore.archive` (`charter/memstore.py:503`).
  Commands: `workspace remember|note`, `workspace forget`, `ws todo done` (writes a closing
  memory, `charter/commands_workspace.py:1516`), `workspace optimize --apply`, `fork` (copy).
  **In purlis, also** `workspace edit <slug>` (`memstore::edit`, an edit in place — see
  [Editing and archiving a memory](#editing-and-archiving-a-memory-purlis)) and
  `workspace archive|unarchive <slug>` (`memstore::archive_one`, `memstore::unarchive`),
  and the window's memory tab, which calls the same functions (ADR 0065). **In purlis,
  also** the first run's *Memory from the repo* tab (FR-18a,
  `purlis_core::repoinstructions::import`): a clone's `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and
  `.cursor/rules/**/*.{md,mdc}`, one memory each through `remember_titled`, titled
  `<file> from <repo>` with the file's text as it is, and only on the tab's press. It keeps no
  store of its own: a file is already imported when a memory's body holds its text.
- **Read by:** `memstore.files`/`entries`/`search` (`charter/memstore.py:169`, `289`, `367`),
  `workspace.recall` (`charter/workspace.py:4244`), `recall.py`, `doctor` (index drift),
  `last_active` (`charter/workspace.py:4424`).
- **Git:** gitignored unless LIVE; the block un-ignores both `memory` and `memory/**`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1398`) — two lines, because un-ignoring the directory alone does
  not re-include its files.

#### `workspaces/<ws>/memory/MEMORY.md`

- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Encoding details:** created once, `config.create_for`, with the header at
  `charter/workspace.py:1802` formatted with the workspace name, and a trailing `\n`
  guaranteed (`charter/memstore.py:97`). Entries are **appended** as
  `- [{title}]({filename})\n` (`charter/memstore.py:144`), in `"a"` mode — no rewrite, so
  the order is the order memories were written. **purlis escapes `\`, `[` and `]` in the
  title** (`\\`, `\[`, `\]`; SI-9d), so a title that holds `](b.md)` is not read as the end of
  its own line's link; the Python charter wrote the title as it was, and both shapes are read. A
  deletion filters the lines containing `({filename})` and rewrites the file joined with `\n`
  plus one trailing `\n` (`charter/memstore.py:489`); **purlis filters, of the lines
  starting `- [`, only those whose leading element links `{filename}`** — the link that closes
  the `- [..]` the line starts with, brackets the title balances and escaped characters not
  counting — so a line whose title mentions another memory's file survives that memory's
  deletion. A line of any other shape is filtered as purlis filters it. Index links are recognised by
  `\(([A-Za-z0-9][\w.-]*\.md)\)` (`charter/memstore.py:214`), every match anywhere in the file;
  **purlis reads a line that starts `- [` by the same leading link a deletion reads it by,
  and nothing else in it** (SI-9e), so a title that mentions `(b.md)` does not list `b.md` — the
  line of a memory unarchived beside it is appended, and `optimize` counts it as unindexed until
  it is. A line of any other shape, or whose leading element never closes, is read by purlis's
  pattern. Every purlis append to the index — `write`, `unarchive`, `optimize --apply`'s
  repair and the legacy `notes.md` line below — runs under the store directory's
  `rewrite::Lock`, which an edit's retitle and a deletion also hold (SI-9d, SI-9e, SI-9f): an
  append between a rewrite's read and its replace went with the old file.
  A legacy `notes.md` is grandfathered into the index once, as
  `- [Task memo (legacy)](notes.md)` (`charter/workspace.py:1824`). purlis appends it when the
  index text holds no `(notes.md)` anywhere; **purlis appends it when the index does not
  list `notes.md` by the reading above** (SI-9f), so a title that mentions `(notes.md)` no
  longer stands in for the memo's own line.

#### `workspaces/<ws>/memory/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md`

- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Encoding details:**
  - Filename: `now.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S-")` + `slug(title)` + `.md`
    (`charter/memstore.py:119`–`121`). **The stamp is LOCAL time** — `datetime.datetime.now()`
    with no timezone (`charter/memstore.py:65`).
  - Slug: lowercase, every run of `[^a-z0-9]+` → `-`, stripped of leading/trailing `-`,
    truncated to 48 chars, `"note"` when empty (`charter/memstore.py:23`, `26`–`28`).
  - Collision: `-2`, `-3`, … appended before `.md` while the path exists
    (`charter/memstore.py:122`–`124`).
  - Title: the first non-blank line of the body, stripped, capped at `TITLE_MAX = 72`
    (`charter/memstore.py:33`, `charter/memstore.py:36`), or an explicit `--title`.
  - Body: `"# {title}\n\n_{now:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M} · {kind}_\n\n{text}\n"`
    (`charter/memstore.py:132`); `kind` is `"persistent"` for workspace memories (the
    default, `charter/memstore.py:102`). The text is `.strip()`ed; empty raises.
  - Closed todos: `ws todo done <slug>` writes a memory whose text is
    `f"Closed todo: {title}"` before deleting the todo
    (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1516`–`1517`), so its filename is
    `<stamp>-closed-todo-<slug-of-the-title>.md`.
  - `memory/archive/<name>.md` holds retired memories, moved by `memstore.archive`
    (`charter/memstore.py:510`, `charter/memstore.py:524`); it is out of every listing
    because listings take only `*.md` directly in the directory
    (`charter/memstore.py:208`).
  - `memory/notes.md` is the pre-v2 single-log memo, still read by
    `workspace.read_notes` (`charter/workspace.py:4271`) and never written any more.

#### Editing and archiving a memory (purlis)

**purlis only**; the Python charter has no edit and no unarchive. These are the rules for
every memory store — a workspace's journal, a persona's `memory/` and `personas/_shared/memory/`
— and change no file's shape: an edited memory is a file `memstore.write` could have written,
and an archived one is where `memstore.archive` would have put it (ADR 0065).

- **An edit rewrites one memory file in place.** New title and new text; the **filename does not
  change** — the slug was minted from the first title and is how every command names the memory,
  so retitling it renames nothing. The file becomes
  `# {title}\n\n{stamp line}\n\n{text}\n`, where the stamp line is the one the file already had,
  **verbatim** (its date and its `kind` both kept: an edit does not re-date a memory); a file
  written by hand with no stamp line gets none. The title is stripped and capped at
  `TITLE_MAX = 72`, an empty one is the text's first line (as `write` derives one), and a title
  holding a line break is refused. An empty text is refused, as `write` refuses it. The file is
  replaced whole (`rewrite::replace`), under the store's mode rules.
- **A memory is named exactly.** Edit, archive and unarchive act on the file whose name is the
  slug given (with `.md`), and on no other: `deploy` never reaches `prod-deploy.md` (SI-9d). The
  command line's verbs first turn a typed slug into that name by the lookup `ws todo done` uses
  — an exact name, else the one file whose name ends `-<slug>.md` — and **refuse a slug more
  than one file ends in**, naming them; `forget` and `ws todo done|forget` refuse it too, where
  purlis took the first in sorted order. `MEMORY` is the index and is refused as a slug.
- **The index line is retitled, not moved.** Every line of `MEMORY.md` whose leading
  `- [..](..)` element links `{filename}` (the rule a deletion reads it by, above) has that
  element replaced by `- [{title}]({filename})`, the title escaped; anything after the link
  stays, and the line keeps its place. No line is added for a memory the index
  never listed. The rewrite is the same whole-file replacement as a deletion's.
- **An edit is checked against the file as it was read.** The caller hands back the file's whole
  text as it read it; when the file on disk differs, the edit is refused as **stale** and nothing
  is written, so a window never saves over a change it did not see. An explicit overwrite skips
  the check. The check and the write happen under the store directory's `rewrite::Lock`.
- **Archiving moves the file to `<store>/archive/<filename>` and drops its index line**, exactly
  as `memstore.archive` does (a taken name gets `-2`, `-2-3`, …). Archiving a memory that is
  already in `archive/` under its own name is not an error and changes nothing.
- **Unarchiving moves `archive/<name>` back into the store and appends its index line**
  (`- [{title}]({filename})`, title read as every reader reads one) unless the index already
  lists it. It is restored under its own name, or under a name the caller gives — how an undo
  puts back a memory that archiving had to number. A name the store already holds is refused and
  nothing moves; a memory that is already back, and no longer in `archive/`, is not an error.
- **Neither is a deletion.** `archive/` is still committed and still out of every listing; a
  hard delete is `forget`, and only from the CLI.

#### Moving a memory between scopes (purlis)

**purlis only** (KN-3, #715). A memory moves from one store to another — a workspace's
journal, a persona's `memory/` or `personas/_shared/memory/` — through `memscope::move_memory`,
which the window's Move and `purlis workspace move-memory <slug> --to-…` / `purlis persona
move-memory <name> <slug> [--shared] --to-…` call. No file changes shape: a moved memory is a
file `memstore.write` could have written in its new store.

- **The file is renamed, never copied, and its text is not touched.** Its `# title` and its
  stamp line go with it byte for byte, and no copy is left in the store it left.
- **Its name is its slug in the new store's spelling.** In a persona's store or `_shared` it is
  the name without a journal's `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-` prefix. In a journal it keeps its own name when
  it has that prefix already (from another journal); otherwise the prefix is its stamp line's
  date and time with seconds `00`, so the journal lists it where it was recorded, and the time
  of the move only for a file with no stamp line. **A memory moved out of a journal and back
  has its first name again to the minute, not to the second**: the stamp line holds minutes,
  so `20260302-091437-a-fact.md` comes back as `20260302-091400-a-fact.md`, its text byte for
  byte. The window's Undo of a Move knows the first name and puts the memory back under it to
  the second; that name may differ from the one the move would give only in the journal's
  prefix, and it is refused like any other name the store already holds. A memory moved between
  persona stores, or between journals, keeps its name exactly.
- **Its index line moves with it**: `- [{title}]({filename})` is appended to the new store's
  index (made with that store's header when it has none: the journal's own, or `# Memory Index`
  for a persona's, as `remember` makes one) and dropped from the old one's.
- **Refused, with nothing moved:** a target that already holds a memory of the same name once a
  journal's prefix is taken off either; the store it is in already; a workspace or persona the
  project does not have; a store or an index a link takes out of the project, or an index that
  is not a file; and a store the filesystem will not let purlis write. Both stores are locked
  (`rewrite::Lock`'s flock) for the whole move, in the order of their paths, and reached by
  descriptor without following a link. **Nothing is made until every check has passed**: a
  target store that is not there yet is made only for the rename, and taken away again, empty,
  when the rename fails.
- **The rename never replaces anything** — `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` on Linux,
  `renameatx_np(RENAME_EXCL)` on macOS, a plain `renameat` after a look on a filesystem that has
  neither — so a file a writer that does not take the lock put at the name meanwhile is left
  alone and the move is refused. An index append that fails after the rename renames the file
  back the same way; when that fails too, the refusal says the memory stayed in the new store
  with no index line.
- **Persona and shared memory are published with the project.** A memory moved out of a LOCAL
  workspace's journal into a persona's store or `_shared` goes with the project's next save.

### `workspaces/<ws>/todos/`

- **Format:** the same per-file memory store, with its own header. One file per todo plus
  `MEMORY.md`.
- **Status:** stable — committed for LIVE workspaces, listed by `ws todo`, counted by the
  status line and by `workspace remove`'s warning, and inherited by `fork`.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Written by:** `todos.scaffold` (`charter/todos.py:73`), `todos.add`
  (`charter/todos.py:93`); commands `purlis ws todo "<text>"`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1462`), `ws todo done|forget <slug>` (deletes —
  `charter/commands_workspace.py:1519`), `fork` (directory copy,
  `charter/commands_workspace.py:1702`).
- **Read by:** `todos.open_todos` (`charter/todos.py:219`), `todos.count_open`
  (`charter/todos.py:236`), `todos.search` (`charter/todos.py:232`),
  `todos.duplicate_of` (`charter/todos.py:133`), `last_active`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4424`).
- **Git:** gitignored unless LIVE — `todos` and `todos/**`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1399`), matched by `_ws_meta_paths`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1118`).
- **Encoding details:** exactly the memory-file rules above (`todos.add` calls
  `memstore.write(..., timestamped=True, index=True)`), so a todo file is
  `<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md` holding `# <title>`, `_<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> · persistent_`,
  the body. The index header is at `charter/todos.py:31`. **There is no state field**:
  closing deletes the file and its index line (ADR 0004/0006,
  `charter/commands_workspace.py:1469`). The slug a caller closes by is the file stem, and
  it must be one path segment (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1498`). Ordering is the
  filename's second resolution (whole seconds, ties broken alphabetically,
  `charter/todos.py:93`, `charter/memstore.py:119`). Age comes from the in-body `_YYYY-MM-DD` stamp, falling back
  to the filename prefix (`charter/memstore.py:150`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/work/<device>.jsonl` — the work link log

- **Format:** JSON Lines, one object per line, append-only, one file per device: `<device>` is
  this device's id from the machine store (ADR 0066), never a hostname. Each line is written
  whole, in one write, so git's `union` driver always keeps whole lines.
- **Status:** **written** ([ADR
  0088](adr/0088-a-work-items-identity-is-its-tracker-key-and-the-project-records-its-links.md),
  V40, FW-5 #732). Absent in a workspace nothing has linked or promoted.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL — committed with a LIVE workspace, as its todos are, because FI6's links must reach the operator's other devices; unlike the piece claim log and the landing log, which stay in their clone.
- **Written by:** `purlis_core::work::log` (`append`, and `append_alias`, which refuses an
  alias that would close a cycle). Its writers today:
  - `purlis ws todo promote`: a `promoted` alias (`purlis_core::work::promote`);
  - the app's host, for the window: a chat's link and unlink (`log::link_chat` and
    `log::unlink_chat`, called by `chat_work_link` and `chat_work_unlink` in
    `app/src-tauri/src/worklinks.rs`), which the window offers as **Link to work item…** and
    **Unlink work item** on a chat tab's menu and in the palette (V60). The line goes in this
    device's log of the workspace the window files the chat under, and names the chat by its
    ULID, which V43 keeps across a relaunch and a move and mints again in a copy. Linking a chat
    to the item it already works on, after both are resolved, writes nothing when that
    workspace's log holds the link, and writes a line when another workspace's does, so this
    workspace's items hold it. An unlink names the item the chat's link resolves to, and a chat
    with no link writes nothing. A chat at the project root, or working outside the project, is
    refused both (ADR 0088 §4).

  **A line is never dated before the last line of the log it goes in**, so a clock that stepped
  back cannot reorder one device's own lines. **A chat's link or unlink is also dated at least
  one second after the last line any log holds for that chat.** The fold orders by `(ts, device
  file, line index, workspace)`, so without that a line in the same second as the chat's link
  in another workspace's log could sort before it, whatever line each sits on. After the line
  is written the logs are folded again. A line synced from another device in that moment can
  still undo it, and that is reported as refused, with what the chat works on now, never as
  done.

  The Work list's workspace links, `workspace rename`'s `renamed` aliases and the item cache's
  `moved` aliases (FW-7) are **decided, not yet written**.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::work::log::fold`, for the Work list (`work::list::of`, which the
  board, FW-9, will draw), `purlis ws todo` (which finishes closing a promoted todo whose
  close a crash cut short), and `purlis doctor`'s `work links` row, shown only when there is
  something to report: a todo a promote aliased but did not close, skipped lines (named by
  file), or an alias cycle.
- **Git:** committed when LIVE: the LIVE block holds `!/workspaces/<n>/work` and
  `!/workspaces/<n>/work/**`, a LIVE workspace's staged paths hold `work`, and the
  `.gitattributes` block holds `workspaces/*/work/*.jsonl merge=union`. Gitignored when LOCAL, by
  `/workspaces/*/*`. `workspace fork` does not copy it.
- **Encoding details:** each line is one of four closed key sets, `v` being `1` and `ts` UTC
  ISO-8601 seconds (`2026-10-02T08:12:00Z`); `item`, `from` and `to` are tracker keys (ADR 0088
  §1) and `chat` a chat's ULID in its canonical spelling. A line with any other key set, `v`,
  `op`, `cause` or `ts`, or a key or chat id that does not parse, is skipped and counted.
  Readers fold every file in every workspace's `work/`, sorted by `ts`, then file name, then
  line, a tie that leaves going to the workspace's name (ADR 0088's implementation erratum). A line never holds an item's title, body, labels, state or forge id, nor
  the local principal.
- **The fold:** every key is read through its aliases first; a cycle a merge made stops before
  the first key it would repeat. A chat's link is its last chat link across every workspace's
  log, ended by a later chat unlink naming the same item once both are resolved. A workspace's
  items are its own links, less those a later unlink names, plus the item of each chat whose
  current link its log wrote. Every directory and file is read through containment, and one
  that resolves out of the project is not read.

| Line | Keys | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| workspace link | `v`, `ts`, `op: "link"`, `item` | the workspace holds the item |
| chat link | `v`, `ts`, `op: "link"`, `item`, `chat` | the chat works on the item; the last one per chat, across every workspace, wins |
| unlink | `v`, `ts`, `op: "unlink"`, `item`, and `chat` for a chat's | the link ends |
| alias | `v`, `ts`, `op: "alias"`, `from`, `to`, `cause` | `from` resolves to `to`; `cause` is `promoted`, `moved` or `renamed` |

### `workspaces/<ws>/refs/README.md` (and whatever else the operator drops in `refs/`)

- **Format:** Markdown; the rest of the directory is arbitrary operator content.
- **Status:** stable — it is a baseline component `structure_status` reports and `reinit`
  repairs, and the operator writes into the directory.
- **Tier:** Clone state — `refs/` is never in the LIVE block, so it is per clone even for a LIVE workspace.
- **Written by:** `workspace.scaffold` (`charter/workspace.py:1855`–`1864`), only when
  `_exists(rr, follow=True) is False`, through `config.create_for`.
- **Read by:** `_required_components` (`charter/workspace.py:4511`), `last_active`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4424`), `recall`'s ref search (`charter/recall.py:130` is the
  persona twin).
- **Git:** gitignored always — `refs/` is **not** in the LIVE block
  (`charter/workspace.py:1397`–`1401`).
- **Encoding details:** body is
  `f"# {name} — task references\n\nDrop docs, links, and snippets for this task here (local, gitignored).\n"`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1864`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/` and `sessions/` — session records

- **Format:** a directory of Markdown files, one per **session record**, plus `index.md`.
- **Status:** stable — **purlis only** (SI-8, ADR 0064); the Python charter never wrote
  one. Written when a chat closes through Smart close, and read by the next chat's briefing.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL — the plane root's `sessions/` is always committed.
- **Where:** `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/` for a chat in a workspace; `sessions/` at the plane
  root for a chat at the plane root, which is in no workspace. Not `.charter/sessions/`, which
  holds per-chat pointers (below) and has nothing to do with these.
- **Written by:** `purlis session record` alone (`sessionrecord::record`), with the body on
  standard input. The app never writes one.
- **Read by:** `purlis session list|show`, the session-start briefing (one line naming the
  place's newest record, or — for a chat the app's **Resume** started — the resumed record
  quoted whole, up to a bound), the app's Sessions panel and record tab, and the smart-close
  skill's successors. A record is named everywhere by its plane-relative path,
  `sessions/<file>` or `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/<file>`, and `sessionrecord::locate` refuses
  every other spelling. What a reader takes from the frontmatter is held to a shape on the way
  in, because the file can be edited: a persona only as a persona name, a harness only as a
  word, a profile only as a profile name, a conversation only as a session id, and a `cwd`
  only as a plane-relative path of plain components — no `..`, no `.` but the whole value, not
  absolute, no backslash. **Resume** starts in it only where it is still a directory inside the
  record's place once every link is followed; otherwise in the place's own directory, and says
  so.
- **Git:** a workspace's follow the workspace — un-ignored by the LIVE block's `sessions` pair,
  kept on disk for a LOCAL one. The plane root's are ignored by `/sessions/` in the plane's
  `.gitignore`: kept on this machine, because the plane root has no LIVE switch (ADR 0064).
- **A record**, `<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<slug>.md`: the local time it was written, and
  `memstore::slug` of its title; a name already taken gets `-2`, `-3`, …. Chosen under an
  advisory lock on the directory and written whole (temp file and rename). The file is:

  ```text
  ---
  title: <title>
  date: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>
  chat: <the app's number for the chat | unknown>
  chat-name: <the name its tab shows | unknown>
  persona: <name | none>
  harness: <claude | codex | opencode | unknown>
  profile: <the harness profile the chat ran on | unknown>
  conversation: <the harness's conversation id | unknown>
  workspace: <ws | plane root>
  cwd: <the directory the chat ran in, plane-relative (. for the plane root) | unknown>
  sandbox: off                                       (only for a chat whose run was unsandboxed)
  piece: <repo>/<piece> @ <branch | (detached)>      (zero or more lines)
  chat-id: <the chat's ULID | unknown>                (decided, ADR 0066; not yet written)
  device: <the chat's origin device id | unknown>     (decided, ADR 0066; not yet written)
  run: <the ULID of the run that wrote it | unknown>  (decided, ADR 0066; not yet written)
  handed-from: <the parent chat's ULID | none>        (decided, ADR 0066; not yet written)
  resumed-from: <the ULID of the chat whose record it resumed | none>   (decided, ADR 0066; not yet written)
  ---

  # <title>

  ## Goal
  …
  ## Done
  …
  ## Decisions
  …
  ## Open
  …
  ## How to resume
  …
  ```

  The frontmatter is line-based (`personas::frontmatter`), every key always written, and is
  purlis's alone: the model gives only the title and the body. `conversation` is
  `reopen::conversation_of` — the app's `reopen.json` `resume` for that chat, which the app
  keeps current from the chat's hook reports. `profile` and `cwd` are the app's `reopen.json`
  `profile` and `cwd` for that chat (added 2026-09-28, SI-8e): the profile by its name, never
  its command, and the directory as a path below the plane root — a chat whose directory is
  outside the plane is `unknown`. A record written before them has neither key, and reads as
  `unknown` for both. `sandbox: off` is written only for a chat whose current run started
  without the sandbox in a project that has it on — the app's `reopen.json` `sandbox` — which is
  where ADR 0067 §7, as ADR 0075 amends it, puts an opt-out beside the event log (added
  2026-10-03, SD-2). Every other record has no `sandbox` line.

  **Identity keys, decided and not yet written** ([ADR
  0066](adr/0066-a-chat-is-a-ulid-a-run-is-a-stretch-of-its-conversation-and-a-device-is-random.md),
  FD-22). `chat:` is the app's display number, which is unique only in one plane on one machine:
  two machines both write `chat: 7`. So a record will also name the chat by its ULID
  (`chat-id`), the device that created it (`device`, a random id from the machine store, never a
  hostname), the run that wrote the record (`run`), and its lineage by id (`handed-from`,
  `resumed-from`), each read from the app's `reopen.json` like `conversation`. Every key is
  written, as `unknown` or `none` when not known. A record never carries the local principal or
  the OS user. Records written before these keys are never rewritten: a reader reads each absent
  key as `unknown`, and a reader that needs a key for such a record uses its plane-relative path.
  `piece`
  lines are the piece the command ran in and each `--piece`, with the branch `git worktree
  list` reports; a `--piece` git does not report is refused. The body is exactly the five
  `## ` sections above, in that order, each non-empty, with nothing before the first (a heading
  inside a code fence is text); at most 32 KiB; no control or invisible formatting character
  but a line feed or a tab; and no credential shape `purlis save` would refuse a memory for.
  The title is one line of at most 120 characters. `sessionrecord::check` is the one judgment.
- **`index.md`**, rebuilt from the records every time one is written, so a hand edit lasts
  until the next record:

  ```text
  # Sessions — workspace `<ws>`            (or: # Sessions — plane root)

  One file per session record, newest first. purlis rebuilds this index from the records each time one is written (`purlis session record`), so an edit here does not last.

  - <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> · [<title, [ and ] escaped>](<file>)
  ```

  Newest first, by file name. A file whose name is not a record's, any link (a workspace's
  records are held with no link on the way, V74; the plane root's allow no link below the plane
  root), and a file over the plane's 1 MiB bound are not records and are not listed.

### `.charter/sessions/<chat>.saved` and `workspaces/<ws>/.charter/sessions/<chat>.saved` — a saved record to pass on

- **Format:** one JSON object and a line feed:
  `{"chat": <the app's number for the chat>, "conversation": <the harness's conversation id | null>, "session_saved": "<the record, absolute>", "at": <unix seconds>}`.
- **Status:** internal — **purlis only** (ADR 0064, amended 2026-09-28; charter#517). Two
  processes of one chat read it, `purlis session record` and that chat's next `Stop` hook, and
  nothing else ever does. Deleting one costs at most a tab that does not close by itself.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — a line waiting for one chat's next `Stop` hook.
- **Why:** a harness can run `purlis session record` in a sandbox that lets it write the
  record and refuses its connect to the app's hook socket — Codex's default `workspace-write`
  does exactly that. The chat's hooks run outside that sandbox, so the record's line is left
  here for the hook that ends the same turn to send.
- **Where:** in the directory of the place the chat works — the one `purlis session record`
  files a record in when it is given no `-w`: `.charter/sessions/` below the plane root for a
  chat at the plane root, `workspaces/<ws>/.charter/sessions/` for a chat in `<ws>`. The chat's
  own directory, which is where a sandbox lets a command write. `<chat>` is the number, as
  `$CHARTER_CHAT` spells it. (At the plane root it sits beside the `<sid>.persona` and
  `<sid>.workspace` pointers below, whose `<sid>` is often the same number; the suffix keeps
  them apart.)
- **Written by:** `purlis session record`, only when it had a hook socket and a chat to tell
  and the line did not get through (`sessionrecord::relay::leave`): 0600, written whole (temp
  file and rename), its directories created 0700.
- **Read by:** `charter hook stop` in that chat (`sessionrecord::relay::take`), which removes it
  whatever it holds and sends the app the `SessionSaved` line only when it is this chat's
  (`chat`), this conversation's (a `conversation` that is not null must be the one the `Stop`
  names), and at most five minutes old — the time the app waits for a record before it gives a
  Smart close up. A future `at`, a relative `session_saved`, a link, a file over 8 KiB or one
  that does not parse are stale, removed and not sent. The app closes a tab on the line only
  while that chat is being smart-closed, so a line sent twice closes it once.
- **Git:** ignored — the plane root's by `/.charter/`, a workspace's by `/workspaces/*/*`,
  which the LIVE block never un-ignores it from.
- **Collected (purlis):** 30 days after it was written, unless the reopen record brings the
  chat back (`retention::on_open`): the plane root's with the other `.charter/sessions/`
  markers, a workspace's from that workspace's own `.charter/sessions/` (#1004).

### `workspaces/<ws>/changes/<slug>.json` — a cross-repo change

- **Format:** JSON object; `json.dumps(ordered, indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/change.py:781`).
- **Status:** stable — committed for LIVE workspaces, hand-editable, an untrusted input
  validated on read and write.
- **Tier:** Plane when LIVE, Clone state when LOCAL
- **Written by:** `change.write` (`charter/change.py:420`, through `contain.writable` +
  `config.write_for`); commands `purlis change create|add|drop|…`
  (`charter/commands_change.py:175`). Removed by `change.forget`
  (`charter/change.py:435`).
- **Read by:** `change.read` (`charter/change.py:393`), `change.all_for`/`read_all`
  (`charter/change.py:446`, `465`), `change.has_records` (`charter/change.py:368`),
  the frame's gather, `purlis change show|list|land`.
- **Git:** gitignored unless LIVE — `changes` and `changes/**` are un-ignored and
  `changes/log/` is re-ignored inside the block (`charter/workspace.py:1400`–`1401`).
  The directory is created lazily by the first `change create`, never by `scaffold`
  (`charter/change.py:335`).
- **Encoding details:** the serialiser is canonical — top-level keys in `KEYS` order,
  each member's keys in `MEMBER_KEYS` order, each exclusion's in `EXCLUSION_KEYS` order
  (`charter/change.py:778`–`781`), so a record read and written back is byte-identical.
  The slug must satisfy `instance.change_name_ok` — `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`
  (`charter/instance.py:211`, `charter/change.py:352`) — and must equal `rec["change"]`
  (`charter/change.py:520`). The key set is **closed at both ends**: an unknown or a missing
  key is a `RecordError` (`charter/change.py:569`–`585`). Every string field must be one
  plain line within `contain.PATH_DISPLAY_LIMIT` (`charter/change.py:97`,
  `charter/change.py:599`–`605`). There is no state field of any kind.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `change` | string | required, `== slug` | the change's name | stable | `charter/change.py:83` |
| `why` | string | required, one line | what the work is for | stable | `charter/change.py:526` |
| `created` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601 seconds, from `commands_change._now` | stable | `charter/commands_change.py:108`, `charter/commands_change.py:227` |
| `by` | string | required | `git config user.name`, else `$USER`, else `"unknown"` | stable | `charter/commands_change.py:111` |
| `members` | list | required, `[]` | one row per participating repo | stable | `charter/change.py:759` |
| `members[].repo` | string | required | repo name, `contain.segment_ok` (not `valid_name`: `.github` is legal) | stable | `charter/change.py:609` |

| `excluded[].at` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601 seconds when it was dropped | stable | `charter/commands_change.py:321` |

### `workspaces/<ws>/changes/log/<device>.jsonl` — the landing log

- **Format:** JSON Lines, one object per line, `O_APPEND`, no lock.
- **Status:** stable — it is read by a *different* process from the one that wrote it (the
  frame's pane, `change show`, the land gate), and by other hosts' purlis on the same disk;
  never committed.
- **Tier:** Clone state — never committed, and not derived: it is this clone's record of what it landed.
- **Written by:** `commands_change._append_landing` (`charter/commands_change.py:1092`), from
  `purlis change land` (`charter/commands_change.py:1501`), after the merge is read back.
  `change.record_landing` (`charter/change.py:156`) is a second writer with the same shape
  — see the Appendix. In this app: `change::landing::append`, from `purlis change land`
  (`crates/purlis-core/src/change/land.rs`) once the read-back confirms the merge at the head
  the checks passed on, or from a later `purlis change land` that finds merged, at that head,
  a request purlis's pending landing (below) says it asked for: one queued, or one whose
  read-back failed.
- **Read by:** `change.read_landings` (`charter/change.py:217`), `change.landings`
  (`charter/change.py:189`), `commands_change.landings` (`charter/commands_change.py:1109`),
  `change.declared_landings` (`charter/change.py:244`). In this app:
  `change::landing::landings`, for the land gate's blockers, doctor's `changes` row, and
  `purlis change revert`, which reverts each member at its line's `merge` commit and refuses a
  `merge` that is not a commit id (`[0-9a-f]{7,64}`) before it reaches git.
- **Git:** committed **never** — `/workspaces/<ws>/changes/log/` re-ignored inside the LIVE
  block (`charter/workspace.py:1401`), and `_ws_meta_paths` stages `changes/` only when
  `change.has_records` is true (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1119`).
- **Encoding details:** filename is **the device's name for its logs** (FD-25, ADR 0066):
  this device's id from the machine store (`machine.json`'s `device`), a ULID, so two machines
  that share a hostname write two files and a renamed machine keeps its one. Before that id is
  minted (the first launch that finds none), or where the store keeps none (ADR 0031), it is
  the short hostname the Python charter used: `socket.gethostname().split(".")[0]` with every
  character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` removed, truncated to 32, `"unknown"` when empty
  (`charter/change.py:142`, `charter/pieces.py:71`). Writing a line never mints the id
  (`purlis_core::machine::log_name`). The app mints it at launch, and so does the one CLI
  command that writes the work link log (`purlis ws todo promote`), so a machine that only runs
  the CLI's other commands keeps writing under its hostname until one of those mints the id. A
  file named by a hostname that an earlier version wrote is still read beside the new one,
  since every reader reads every file in the directory; FR-9 renames those (#607). The line is
  `contain.json_line(line, sort_keys=True) + "\n"` — **keys sorted, `ensure_ascii=True`**
  (`charter/commands_change.py:1099`, `charter/contain.py:473`), written with
  `os.open(..., O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0o644)` (`charter/commands_change.py:1100`).
  A reader skips any line that is not an object whose key set is exactly `LOG_FIELDS`
  (`charter/change.py:234`), and sorts by `ts` (`charter/change.py:241`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601 seconds | stable | `charter/commands_change.py:1092` |
| `change` | string | required | the change's slug | stable | `charter/change.py:113` |
| `repo` | string | required | the member that landed | stable | `charter/change.py:113` |
| `number` | int | required | the request number purlis merged | stable | `charter/commands_change.py:1093` |
| `merge` | string | required | sha of the merge commit purlis created | stable | `charter/change.py:113` |
| `head` | string | required | the member branch tip it was created from | stable | `charter/change.py:113` |

### `workspaces/<ws>/changes/log/pending/<device>.jsonl` — pending landings

- **Format:** JSON Lines, one object per line, `O_APPEND`, no lock; keys sorted, ASCII only.
- **Status:** stable — written by one `purlis change land` and read by a later one and by
  doctor; never committed. New in this app (#472, D-472a); the Python charter has no such file,
  and its landing-log reader, which reads `log/*.jsonl`, never reads this directory.
- **Tier:** Clone state — never committed, and not derived: it is this clone's evidence that
  purlis started a landing. Deleting it costs only that: a merge purlis queued and has not
  yet recorded is then never recorded as purlis's.
- **Written by:** `change::pending::append`, from `purlis change land`
  (`crates/purlis-core/src/change/land.rs`): `asked` before it asks the forge to merge or to
  queue, `refused` when the forge refused, `merge-later` when GitLab set the request to merge
  later and purlis could not undo it.
- **Read by:** `change::pending::pendings`, for `purlis change land` (its own member, and
  its blockers), doctor's `changes` row, and `purlis change revert`, which names a member
  purlis started landing and has not logged. The latest line per member, by `ts`, wins; a line
  that is not exactly the seven fields below (`PENDING_FIELDS`) is skipped. A line is
  evidence only while it stands (every stage but `refused`) and names the landing asked about:
  `land` matches the request and its head, doctor the head of the member's pushed branch.
- **Git:** committed **never** — under `/workspaces/<ws>/changes/log/`, which the LIVE block
  re-ignores.
- **Encoding details:** filename `<device>.jsonl`, named as the landing log is (FD-25: the
  device id, the short hostname only before one is minted).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601 seconds | stable | `change::pending` |
| `change` | string | required | the change's slug | stable | `change::pending` |
| `repo` | string | required | the member | stable | `change::pending` |
| `number` | int | required | the request purlis asked the forge to land | stable | `change::pending` |
| `head` | string | required | the head commit the checks passed on, which the call was pinned to | stable | `change::pending` |
| `via` | string | required | `direct` or `queue` | stable | `change::pending` |
| `stage` | string | required | `asked`, `refused` or `merge-later` | stable | `change::pending` |

### `workspaces/<ws>/pieces/<device>.jsonl` — the piece claim log

- **Format:** JSON Lines, `O_APPEND`, no lock.
- **Status:** stable — written by `purlis wt add`/`wt done` and read by the status line,
  `wt list` and the frame; never committed, but read by processes other than the writer.
- **Tier:** Clone state — never committed; this clone's claims on pieces.
- **Written by:** `pieces.record` (`charter/pieces.py:122`), from
  `charter/commands_worktree.py:167` (`claimed`) and `charter/commands_worktree.py:233`
  (`done`/`abandoned`).
- **Read by:** `pieces.events` (`charter/pieces.py:148`), `claims`
  (`charter/pieces.py:167`), `declarations` (`charter/pieces.py:185`), `silence`
  (`charter/pieces.py:368`).
- **Git:** never committed — `pieces` is deliberately absent from the LIVE block
  (`charter/pieces.py:49`), so `/workspaces/*/*` keeps it ignored.
- **Encoding details:** filename `<device>.jsonl`, named as the landing log is (above:
  the device id, the short hostname only before one is minted; `charter/pieces.py:85`,
  `charter/pieces.py:71`). The line's `host` stays the short hostname: a label for whoever
  reads the claim, never what the file is keyed by. Line is
  `json.dumps(line, sort_keys=True) + "\n"` (`charter/pieces.py:120`), `0o644`,
  `O_APPEND` (`charter/pieces.py:122`). A malformed line is skipped
  (`charter/pieces.py:159`); events are sorted by `ts` (`charter/pieces.py:164`).
  Key set is closed by test (`FIELDS`, `charter/pieces.py:55`); the vocabulary is
  `claimed|done|abandoned` and nothing else (`charter/pieces.py:64`), enforced by a
  `ValueError` on write (`charter/pieces.py:101`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | required | UTC ISO-8601 seconds | stable | `charter/pieces.py:105` |
| `event` | string | required | `claimed` / `done` / `abandoned` | stable | `charter/pieces.py:64` |
| `repo` | string | required | clone the worktree belongs to | stable | `charter/pieces.py:107` |
| `piece` | string | required | the worktree/piece name | stable | `charter/pieces.py:108` |
| `session` | string or null | required key | `session.current()` at write time | stable | `charter/pieces.py:109` |
| `host` | string | required | short hostname, as a label: the file is named by the device id (FD-25) | stable | `charter/pieces.py:110` |
| `persona` | string or null | required key | `persona.resolve_active()` | stable | `charter/pieces.py:111` |
| `reason` | string | present only when given | a `done`/`abandoned` reason | stable | `charter/pieces.py:113` |

### `workspaces/<ws>/pieces/seen/<repo>.json` and `pieces/seen/<repo>/<piece>.json`

- **Format:** one small JSON object, **overwritten** each turn.
- **Status:** stable — written by a hook process and read by the status line and `wt list`,
  which are different processes.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — overwritten every turn; losing it loses only a last-seen age.
- **Written by:** `pieces.seen` (`charter/pieces.py:276`), from `hooks._touch_piece`
  (`charter/hooks.py:6264`), which every turn-level handler calls
  (`charter/hooks.py:6352`, `6488`, `7609`, `7775`, `8040`, `8703`).
- **Read by:** `pieces.last_seen` (`charter/pieces.py:330`), `presence`
  (`charter/pieces.py:293`), `seen_age` (`charter/pieces.py:363`), `silence`
  (`charter/pieces.py:384`).
- **Git:** never committed (under `pieces/`).
- **Encoding details:** `json.dumps(blob, sort_keys=True) + "\n"` via `Path.write_text`
  (`charter/pieces.py:276`). A clone's own record is `seen/<repo>.json`; a piece's is
  `seen/<repo>/<piece>.json` (`charter/pieces.py:236`). Keys: `ts` (UTC ISO seconds),
  `session`, and — only when a persona was resolved — `persona` and `by`
  (`charter/pieces.py:268`–`271`). `by` is `{persona: ts}`, pruned to the last hour
  (`PRESENCE_WINDOW`, `charter/pieces.py:220`) and capped at 8 entries
  (`PRESENCE_KEEP`, `charter/pieces.py:225`). purlis (#434) replaces the record whole
  (temp beside, fsync, rename) and refuses one that is a symlink; `Path.write_text` truncated
  it in place and followed a link.

### `workspaces/<ws>/.charter-structure` — the layout stamp

Written as `.purlis-structure`. A `.charter-structure` (or a pre-charter `.edm-structure`) is
renamed to it the first time it is read, keeping its version (V93i).

- **Format:** plain text: the integer version and `\n`.
- **Status:** **stable** — the status line reads it in a different process from the one
  that wrote it. Deleting it makes the workspace read as version 0, so the status line
  flags `⚠ reinit` and
  `purlis workspace reinit` re-stamps it. Nothing else is lost.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — re-stamped by the next scaffold or repair.
- **Written by:** `workspace.scaffold` (`charter/workspace.py:1885`), through a raw
  `os.open(..., O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK, 0o666)`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1880`) — never through a symlink, never into a FIFO.
- **Read by:** `workspace._stamp` (`charter/workspace.py:4539`, `O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|
  O_NONBLOCK`, `int(os.read(fd, 4096).strip())`), `structure_version`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4515`), `structure_status` (`charter/workspace.py:4584`),
  `needs_reinit` (`charter/workspace.py:4618`).
- **Git:** gitignored (`/workspaces/*/*`; not in the LIVE block).
- **Encoding details:** `STRUCTURE_VERSION = 5` today (`charter/workspace.py:4473`) — v2
  memory-as-DB, v3 `changes/` in the LIVE block, v4 the harness layer, v5 every workspace
  has a `workspace.json`. A pre-rename `.edm-structure` is renamed in place on first read
  (`charter/workspace.py:4477`–`4500`). "Current" is `version >= STRUCTURE_VERSION` **and**
  no baseline file missing (`charter/workspace.py:4585`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/.charter-generated` — the harness-layer ownership marker

Written as `.purlis-generated`, with its temps as `.purlis-generated.*.tmp`. A record under
`.charter-generated` is read while it is the only one, and renamed, bytes unchanged, the next
time the layer is wired, so every file it vouched for stays purlis's; a leftover old record
beside a purlis one is removed when the record is published (V93i).

- **Format:** JSON object, `json.dumps(marker, indent=2) + "\n"`
  (`charter/workspace.py:2946`); `{relative path: sha256 hex}` or, while a write is pending,
  `{relative path: [sha256, …]}`.
- **Status:** stable — the same marker shape is written into guest checkouts, where another
  process (a later launch, `doctor`, `reinit`) reads it to decide what is purlis's to
  rewrite, withdraw or hide. Delete it and purlis loses its claim: every generated file
  reads as `foreign` and is never rewritten again, which is the failure mode this file
  exists to avoid, so it is not "safe to delete". **It is never enough on its own** (#1583):
  it sits where a chat may be able to write it, so purlis overwrites or removes a file it
  names only when the project's app state also notes offering that very text at that path
  (`mirrors-offered.json`, which no chat can write). A file only the record vouches for is
  left as it is: `reinit` names it, and a chat in a piece holding one is not started. The
  note is never filled in from a record.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the record of which files purlis owns. It is not rebuildable: without it, every file it vouched for reads as the operator's.
- **Written by:** `workspace._publish_marker` (`charter/workspace.py:2943`) from
  `_materialise` (`charter/workspace.py:2807`, `charter/workspace.py:2837`); removed
  entirely when it would name nothing (`charter/workspace.py:2950`) and by `unwire_guest`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4198`).
- **Read by:** `_read_marker_at` (`charter/workspace.py:2212`), `_layer_status`
  (`charter/workspace.py:2568`), `_charter_owned` (`charter/workspace.py:3336`),
  `_unwanted` (`charter/workspace.py:2611`), `_yours_untracked`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3777`).
- **Git:** gitignored in a workspace directory by `/workspaces/*/*`; in a guest checkout it
  is listed in purlis's `.git/info/exclude` block (`charter/workspace.py:3372`). A marker
  git **tracks** is dropped as untrusted (`charter/workspace.py:2176`, `2239`).
- **Encoding details:** written whole through `_write_whole` — temp
  `.charter-generated.<pid>.<12 hex>.tmp` beside the target, `fsync`, mode of the replaced
  file preserved, one `os.replace` (`charter/workspace.py:2913`–`2924`). Keys must be
  relative in-checkout paths: an absolute, drive-qualified, NUL-bearing or `..`-bearing key
  invalidates the whole marker (`charter/workspace.py:2155`–`2173`, `2237`). A value may be
  a string (settled) or a list of strings (pending, published *before* the write)
  (`charter/workspace.py:2440`–`2456`, `2806`). Key order is dict order: the intent dict is
  built from the marker read plus the writes, so it is effectively the order paths first
  appeared. The digest is `content_digest` — sha256 of the UTF-8 text purlis wrote
  (`charter/workspace.py:1945`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/.claude/settings.json` — the generated harness layer

- **Format:** JSON, `json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n"`
  (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:485`).
- **Status:** stable — Claude Code reads it for any chat rooted in the workspace directory.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — regenerated from the plane at the next launch.
- **Written by:** `workspace.wire_harnesses` → `_materialise` → `_write_whole`
  (`charter/workspace.py:2677`, `charter/workspace.py:2824`), content from
  `ClaudeCodeHarness.workspace_files` (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:447`). Reached from
  `workspace.scaffold` on every `ensure` (`charter/workspace.py:1870`) and from
  `workspace reinit` (`charter/workspace.py:4644`).
- **Read by:** Claude Code itself; purlis reads it back only to compare against what it
  wants (`_layer_status`, `charter/workspace.py:2562`) and to answer
  `rules_not_in_force` (`charter/workspace.py:3984`).
- **Git:** gitignored — `/workspaces/*/*` covers it and the LIVE block never un-ignores
  `.claude/` (`charter/workspace.py:1397`–`1401`).
- **Encoding details:** a 1:1 mirror of the plane's own `.claude/settings.json`, limited to
  `WORKSPACE_KEYS = ("enabledPlugins", "env")` (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:53`) plus a
  `permissions` object holding only the **restrictive** buckets (`ask`, `deny`), appended
  last (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:484`). Empty plane settings → no file and no marker
  entry at all. opencode and Codex contribute nothing here and declare the
  `WORKSPACE_SCOPE` deficit instead (`charter/harness/opencode.py:751`,
  `charter/harness/codex.py:182`), reported by `workspace.harness_deficits`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1971`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/<repo>/` — a cloned repo (guest checkout)

- **Format:** an ordinary git clone. purlis recognises it by `<dir>/.git` being a
  **directory** (`workspace.is_clone`, `charter/workspace.py:300`, via `_directory`
  `charter/workspace.py:2287`); a linked worktree's `.git` is a file and is excluded there
  on purpose. `guest_trees` is the wider question — anything with a resolvable git dir
  (`charter/workspace.py:3126`, `_children` at `charter/workspace.py:3139`).
- **Status:** stable — the operator's own repository. purlis is a guest and writes only
  the paths below.
- **Tier:** None — the operator's own repository, with its own remote. purlis's files inside it carry their own tiers below.
- **Written by (purlis's own files only):** `workspace.wire_guest`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4059`) from `wire_harnesses` (`charter/workspace.py:2680`),
  `purlis clone` (`charter/commands.py:500`) and `purlis wt add`
  (`charter/commands_worktree.py:194`). Removed by `unwire_guest`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4148`) and `unwire_guests` on `workspace remove`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4211`, `charter/commands_workspace.py:374`).
- **Git:** everything purlis writes there is listed one path at a time in that checkout's
  `.git/info/exclude`; purlis never touches the checkout's `.gitignore` and never stages
  anything in it (`charter/workspace.py:1916`–`1920`).
- **Files purlis generates inside a clone** (`_guest_files`, `charter/workspace.py:2135`):
  - `.claude/settings.json` — the same mirror as the workspace directory's.
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` — the plane's **local** ask/deny rules, checkout only
    (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:487`, `CHECKOUT_LOCAL_SETTINGS` at
    `charter/harness/claude_code.py:95`). It is *co-written*: the harness saves "don't ask
    again" into it, so purlis never rewrites it once edited and never withdraws its
    exclude line (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:387`, `charter/workspace.py:3353`).
  - a 1:1 copy of the plane's `.claude/agents/**`, `.claude/skills/**`,
    `.opencode/agent/**`, `.codex/skills/**` — every registered harness's
    `inherited_paths` (`charter/workspace.py:2105`, `charter/harness/claude_code.py:169`,
    `charter/harness/opencode.py:831`, `charter/harness/codex.py:236`). Keys are
    `<declared path>/<relative posix path>` (`charter/workspace.py:2131`).
  - `.charter-generated` — the marker, as above.
- **Encoding details:** a tree whose root does not resolve inside `workspaces/` (or, for a
  piece, inside the worktree root) is never written to — `_wired_tree_ok`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3302`). Every individual write is refused if the path or its
  parent resolves out of the tree (`_inside`, `charter/workspace.py:2848`;
  `_write_whole`, `charter/workspace.py:2906`). Withdrawals only ever reach a path under a
  harness root (`_generated_roots`, `charter/workspace.py:2587`) whose content still matches
  the recorded digest (`charter/workspace.py:2642`), and empty parent directories are pruned
  (`_prune_empty`, `charter/workspace.py:4123`).

### `workspaces/<ws>/<folder>/` — a folder an extension keeps in a workspace

- **Format:** whatever the extension writes there. purlis reads none of it.
- **Status:** **purlis only** (purlis#343, ADR 0053). `<folder>` is the one name an
  approved extension declares as `contributes.events.workspace_folder`: letters, digits, `-`
  and `_`, and never one of purlis's own names in a workspace (`workspace.md`,
  `workspace.json`, `memory`, `todos`, `refs`, `pieces`, `worktrees`, `README.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `manifest.json`).
- **Tier:** None — the extension's own folder; purlis reads none of it.
- **Written by:** the extension's own program, which runs as the operator. purlis does not
  create it.
- **Read by:** `purlis workspace fork`, which copies it into the fork after the purlis, the
  memory and the todos — whether or not the extension is on in the project, and only for an
  extension this machine approved whose bytes are unchanged
  (`crates/purlis-core/src/extension/events.rs` `carried`,
  `crates/purlis-core/src/wscmd/fork.rs`). A folder of that name that is a clone (it holds
  `.git`) is never copied.

### `<clone>/.git/info/exclude` — purlis's managed block

- **Format:** plain text; a delimited block inside a file the operator also owns.
- **Status:** stable — git reads it, and purlis reads it back on every launch and repair.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — the managed block is rewritten on every launch and repair.
- **Written by:** `workspace._register_excludes` (`charter/workspace.py:3876`) through
  `_write_whole` (`charter/workspace.py:3908`), from `wire_guest`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4102`, `charter/workspace.py:4112`) and `unwire_guest`
  (`charter/workspace.py:4207`).
- **Read by:** `_exclude_state` (`charter/workspace.py:3791`), `unaccounted`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3830`), `unhidden` (`charter/workspace.py:3840`), `guest_layer`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3959`) — and git.
- **Git:** never committed, never tracked; it lives in the **common** git directory, so a
  linked worktree and its clone share one (`git_exclude_file`, `charter/workspace.py:269`,
  resolving `commondir` at `charter/workspace.py:287`).
- **Encoding details:**
  - Markers: `# >>> purlis (generated layer — \`purlis workspace reinit\`) >>>` and
    `# <<< purlis <<<`. The markers charter wrote before the rename
    (`# >>> charter (generated layer — \`charter workspace reinit\`) >>>` and
    `# <<< charter <<<`) delimit the block too, and it is rewritten in place under the purlis
    ones, with the old `/.charter-generated` and `.charter-generated.*.tmp` lines kept while
    such a file is still there (V93i). A fixed three-line note sits
    between the begin marker and the paths (`charter/workspace.py:3118`).
  - Each listed path is written as `/<rel>` (anchored), except the temp pattern
    `.purlis-generated.*.tmp`, written unanchored (`charter/workspace.py:3390`,
    `charter/workspace.py:3381`). Block ends with one `\n` (`charter/workspace.py:3391`).
  - Order: sorted rels, then `.purlis-generated`, then the temp pattern
    (`charter/workspace.py:3756`–`3760`).
  - Replacement is in place between the markers; an unterminated block runs to EOF and is
    replaced whole (`_replace_block`, `charter/workspace.py:3404`; `_block_span`,
    `charter/workspace.py:3431`). A file with no block and nothing to add is handed back
    byte for byte (`charter/workspace.py:3419`).
  - The block holds what **every** tree sharing this exclude needs (`_shared_rels`,
    `charter/workspace.py:3656`); a line is only dropped when its path is proved absent in
    all of them, and a line is never *added* over an untracked file of the operator's in a
    sibling tree (`charter/workspace.py:3718`–`3734`).

### `.charter-scan-allow.toml` — the commit scan's allowlist (any repository)

- **Format:** TOML at the top of a repository.
  - `[[allow]]` tables. Each has a required `reason`, and either:
    - a `rule`, an id `purlis scan --explain` prints (`email`, `forge-token`, …), with
      `paths`. `paths` is a list of globs from the repository's top: `*` stays within one
      directory and `**` crosses them. It is required for a rule entry; the whole repository is
      `paths = ["**"]`.
    - a `fingerprint`: `sha256:` and the hex SHA-256 of one key's value, with optional `paths`.
      Personal data (`email`, `card-number`, `us-ssn`) is never let through by fingerprint,
      because the value can be recovered from its hash by guessing. Those rules take `paths`.
  - An optional `[builtin]` table with `enabled = false`, which turns purlis's own entries off.
  - An entry that can't be read, or that breaks one of these rules, allows nothing, and the scan
    says so.
- **Status:** **stable** (SQ-17, ADR 0074 as amended).
- **Tier:** Plane — committed, in a plane. In any other repository it is committed to that
  repository and reviewed like its code, and that repository as a whole stays tier None.
- **Written by:** the operator, by hand, in a commit made outside a chat. purlis never writes
  it. `purlis scan --explain` prints the entry that would let a finding through.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::diffscan::checked` and `purlis scan`, **as it is at `HEAD`**
  (`git show HEAD:.charter-scan-allow.toml`), never from the working tree or the index.
- **Git:** committed. A chat's `pre-commit` refuses a commit that changes it, including a move
  (`--no-renames`). The Bash guard refuses a chat's `git revert` of a commit that changed it, and
  `git merge --ff-only` onto one. A merge commit may bring it as it was committed elsewhere.
  This is a mistake guard: ADR 0074 names the ways past it.
- **Beside it:** purlis's own entry, the same in every repository: an `email` in a file named
  `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `.mailmap`, `AUTHORS`, `CONTRIBUTORS` or `CHANGELOG` (the last
  three also `.md` and `.txt`), at any depth.

### Provenance trailers — in the message of every commit an agent run makes (any repository)

- **Format:** git trailers, `git interpret-trailers` syntax, in the commit message's last
  paragraph, in this order. Ruling V67 (#702, GL-8).

  ```text
  Assisted-by: <harness>:<model>
  Purlis-Chat: <chat ULID>
  Purlis-Persona: <persona>
  Purlis-Change: <change slug>
  ```

  Commits made before the rename carry `Charter-Chat`, `Charter-Persona` and `Charter-Change`.
  Those spellings are recognised for good (V93j): `change revert` finds a landing by either
  `Charter-Change` or `Purlis-Change`, and a message that already has a `Charter-*` trailer with
  the same value is not given its `Purlis-*` twin.

  - `Assisted-by` is the Linux kernel's original form (`Documentation/process/coding-assistants.rst`,
    78d979db6cef). `<harness>` is one of `claude-code`, `codex` and `opencode` (V67(b)), taken
    from the kind of the harness profile the chat was started on, never from the program it
    runs. `<model>` is the model as its provider names it, as the chat's harness last reported
    it in its `SessionStart` hook (`chats[].model` in `app/reopen.json`, #1021). Claude Code's
    payload names it; a harness whose payload does not, or a chat whose harness has not started
    yet, has no model known. When purlis does not know the model, the value is `<harness>` alone,
    with no colon. A model switched inside the session (`/model`) is named from the next
    `SessionStart`, which a `/clear`, a compaction or a resume fires. With
    `assisted_by = "llm"` (below) it is `Assisted-by: LLM`, the kernel's form since 816d9992d9ed.
  - `Purlis-Chat` names the chat by its ULID (ADR 0066), never by its number.
  - `Purlis-Persona` is the persona the chat adopted.
  - `Purlis-Change` is the change whose record has a member for this repo on the branch the
    commit is on (ADR 0060).
  - A trailer whose value purlis does not know is left out. A value that is not one word of
    printable ASCII, or is longer than 100 characters, counts as unknown. A line already in the
    message is not added again, so an amend carries each trailer once.
  - **purlis only appends.** Every byte the message already had stays as written, including
    the agent's own trailers (`Co-authored-by:x` is not reformatted) and a `---` line, which is
    text and not a patch divider. The lines go after the message's last line of text, joining
    its trailer block when that paragraph is one, and after a blank line otherwise. In an
    edited message they go before the closing comment lines, and nothing below git's scissors
    line is touched. `git interpret-trailers` is not run, so a repository's `trailer.*`
    configuration is neither read nor run.
  - There is no on-behalf-of trailer. The human is the commit's author.
  - **Only below the chat's harness** (V82, #1018). A commit is stamped only when the process
    making it descends from the program the app started for the chat, as `chats[].pid` in
    `app/reopen.json` records it. A program that only inherited the chat's environment, such as
    an editor opened from it, stamps nothing. **A sandboxed chat's commits get no trailers yet on
    Linux, and neither does anything on Windows**: the check cannot reach the harness there,
    and it fails closed. On macOS a sandboxed chat's commits are stamped like any other
    chat's (D-1407-8b). ADR 0074 lists the limits of that check.
  - **A claim, not proof.** The agent writes its own commit message, so it can type any of these
    lines, change them, or make a commit the hook never sees. Treat them as what the agent run
    says about itself, for reading history. Nothing should take them as a security signal or as
    evidence of who made a change.
- **Status:** **stable**. These are public: they are written into the history of every repository
  an agent commits to, and are hard to take back.
- **Tier:** None — they live in the repository's own history, and purlis keeps no copy.
- **Written by:**
  - a chat's `commit-msg` hook, for every commit the agent makes itself in a chat whose git runs
    purlis's hooks (ADR 0074 as amended by V67). `purlis git-hook commit-msg` reads the chat
    from `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID` and the app's record (`purlis_core::provenance::stamp`). It
    never refuses a commit, and a `purlis` that has gone leaves the message as written;
  - `purlis save`, when it is run inside a chat, for the project save it commits
    (`purlis_core::planegit`).
- **Never written** on a commit the operator makes by hand: their terminal is not armed, a
  save from the window's button or from auto-save is the app's, and a shell tab is no harness.
  **An auto-save stays the app's** (#1011): after the quiet period, at a session's end and at
  quit, it commits whatever the tree holds, which several chats and the person may have written,
  and nothing records who wrote which change. A session-end save is not attributed to the chat
  that ended either: that would write a guess into history, which cannot be taken back. An
  agent's work is stamped where the agent commits it.
- **Spelled per repo:** `[plane].assisted_by` and `[repos.<name>].assisted_by`, `"full"` (the
  default) or `"llm"` in any case, in `charter.toml` (see the table above). A `[repos.<name>]`
  that does not set it follows `[plane].assisted_by`. A repository the project does not hold gets
  the full form.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::provenance::Claims::read`, which every reader in purlis goes through
  (AU-15, RC-15 and FG-11 are to be its first callers); outside purlis,
  `git log --format='%(trailers)'` and `git interpret-trailers --parse` read them. **One rule for
  readers** (#1019):
  - Read the trailer block as git parses it (`git log --format='%(trailers:only,unfold)'`), never
    the whole message: a body line that only looks like a trailer claims nothing.
  - A key is read under every spelling it has had (`Purlis-Chat` and `Charter-Chat` are one key),
    in any case, as git compares trailer keys. A value that is not one word of printable ASCII
    of at most 100 characters would not be written, and alone it claims nothing. Beside any
    other value for the key it is a second claim, so the key has several (below): reading fails
    closed, since nothing says which line was the commit's (#1021).
  - The same value twice is one claim. **Two or more different values for one key mean the
    commit's provenance for that key is unknown**: a reader says that several are claimed, and
    attributes the commit to none of them. It does not take the last value as purlis's. purlis
    appends its own line only where the same line is not already there, and an agent can type
    any line after it as well as before it, so the position of a line says nothing about who
    wrote it. A commit can come to carry several by an agent typing its own, or by a cherry-pick
    or an amend that brings another chat's along.
  - The other keys still stand: only the key with several values is unknown.

### `workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/<repo>/<piece>/` — pieces

- **Format:** git linked worktrees.
- **Status:** stable — the layout is a contract: `worktree.locate` and `workspace.from_path`
  derive the active workspace from a path of exactly this shape.
- **Tier:** None — git's worktrees and the operator's work in them (ADR 0027); git is their registry.
- **Written by:** `git worktree add` under `purlis wt add`; the path comes from
  `worktree.path_for` (`charter/worktree.py:77`) and `worktree.root`
  (`charter/worktree.py:34`).
- **Read by:** `worktree.locate` (`charter/worktree.py:37`), `dirs_for`
  (`charter/worktree.py:238`), `list_for` (`charter/worktree.py:128`),
  `workspace._pieces` (`charter/workspace.py:3180`), `_piece_at`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3247`).
- **Git:** `DIR_NAME = ".worktrees"` (`charter/worktree.py:28`) starts with a dot, so it is
  never taken for a repo (`charter/workspace.py:450`) and is gitignored by
  `/workspaces/*/*`.
- **Encoding details:** the in-plane layout is `workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/<repo>/<piece>`;
  with a relocated root it is `<root>/<ws>/<repo>/<piece>` and `.worktrees` disappears from
  the path (`charter/worktree.py:31`–`34`, `charter/worktree.py:53`–`58`). The root is
  `$CHARTER_WORKTREES` → `[plane] worktrees` → `None` (in-plane)
  (`charter/config.py:82`–`88`); a *committed* `[plane] worktrees` must be plane-adjacent
  (`contain.plane_adjacent`, `charter/config.py:88`), the env var takes anything. **Git is
  the only registry** — nothing records a worktree in workspace state
  (`charter/worktree.py:3`); purlis's own listing spawns
  `git worktree list --porcelain` with the repository-local git env unset and a 5 s timeout
  (`charter/workspace.py:3623`, `_GIT_TIMEOUT` at `charter/workspace.py:3451`,
  `_GIT_ENV` at `charter/workspace.py:3464`). purlis writes the same guest layer into each
  piece (`charter/workspace.py:3136`).

### `.gitignore` (plane root) — the managed live-workspace block

- **Format:** plain text block inside the plane's own `.gitignore`.
- **Status:** stable — committed, so liveness travels with the plane; it *is* the record of
  which workspaces are LIVE.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `workspace._write_live_block` (`charter/workspace.py:1418`) from
  `set_live` (`charter/workspace.py:1440`) and `refresh_live_block`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1430`, called by every `reinit`, `charter/workspace.py:4650`).
  Commands: `purlis workspace live [--off]`, `workspace create --live`, `fork --live`,
  `rename` (moves the entry, `charter/workspace.py:1490`).
- **Read by:** `workspace.live_workspaces` (`charter/workspace.py:1346`), `is_live`
  (`charter/workspace.py:1366`) — and git.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:**
  - Markers, verbatim:
    `# >>> charter live workspaces (managed by \`charter workspace live\`) >>>` and
    `# <<< charter live workspaces <<<`; in a project migrated to purlis names,
    `# >>> purlis live workspaces (managed by \`purlis workspace live\`) >>>` and
    `# <<< purlis live workspaces <<<`. Either pair is read, and the block is rewritten in
    place under the project's pair the next time it is written (V93g, V93i).
  - Eleven lines per LIVE workspace, workspaces sorted by name
    (`charter/workspace.py:1396`–`1401`):
    `!/workspaces/<n>/workspace.json`, `!/workspaces/<n>/workspace.md`,
    `!/workspaces/<n>/memory`, `!/workspaces/<n>/memory/**`,
    `!/workspaces/<n>/todos`, `!/workspaces/<n>/todos/**`,
    `!/workspaces/<n>/sessions`, `!/workspaces/<n>/sessions/**`,
    `!/workspaces/<n>/changes`, `!/workspaces/<n>/changes/**`,
    `/workspaces/<n>/changes/log/`. The `sessions` pair is purlis's (ADR 0064): a
    workspace's session records follow it, LIVE or LOCAL. A block written before it is brought
    up to date by `reinit`, as any older block is.
  - Lines are joined with `\n` and the block has no trailing newline of its own; the rewrite
    is `re.sub(BEGIN .*? END, block, flags=DOTALL)` (`charter/workspace.py:1412`). A first
    write is inserted directly after the literal line `!/workspaces/.gitkeep\n`
    (`charter/workspace.py:1414`) — the anchor `purlis init` writes
    (`charter/commands.py:1091`) — else appended at EOF with one blank-free `\n` on each side
    (`charter/workspace.py:1417`). Written with a plain `gi.write_text`, non-atomically.
    **In purlis** (#358) it is replaced by rename, and `set_live` reads the block and
    writes the next one under the plane root's `flock`, so two workspaces made LIVE at once
    are both LIVE.
  - Liveness is *parsed back* only from the `workspace.json` line:
    `^!/workspaces/([^/]+)/workspace\.json$` inside the block
    (`charter/workspace.py:1360`).
  - What a LIVE workspace actually stages is `_ws_meta_paths`
    (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1094`, list built at `charter/commands_workspace.py:1116`): `workspace.json`, `workspace.md`, `memory`,
    `todos`, `sessions` (purlis; each only if it exists) and `changes` only when `change.has_records`
    (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1119`). The two lists must agree and only a test holds
    them together.
  - **In purlis, going LOCAL also untracks** what the block had published
    (`git rm --cached`, files kept on disk) and saves the plane, and going LIVE saves it at
    once. History already pushed stays on the remote (ADR 0051).

### `.charter/…` — active-workspace pointers and per-plane workspace state

These are `.charter`'s to document in full; named here because they decide which workspace
a command acts on, or record workspace state.

| Path | Tier | What it holds | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.charter/sessions/<sid>.workspace` | Clone state, transient | the workspace chosen for that session, `name + "\n"` | stable (read by the status line, hooks, every command) | `charter/workspace.py:66`, written `charter/workspace.py:823` |
| `.charter/sessions/<sid>.lock` | Clone state, transient | the workspace that session is locked to, `name + "\n"` | stable | `charter/workspace.py:709`, written `charter/workspace.py:824` |
| `.charter/terminals/<tid>.workspace` | Clone state, transient | the terminal pane's workspace | stable | `charter/workspace.py:192`, written `charter/workspace.py:819` |
| `.charter/workspace-tab-order` | Clone state, legacy | one workspace name per line, the tab strip's order | stable — the frame and the palette read the order another process wrote; deleting it costs the order, which the next launch recomputes (`charter/workspace.py:1066`) | `charter/workspace.py:978`, written `charter/workspace.py:1023` |
| `.charter/workspace-arrivals/<name>` | Clone state, transient, legacy | empty file; its existence marks "a handoff landed here" | stable — one process records the arrival, another reads it; deleting it clears the mark only | `charter/workspace.py:1113`, `charter/workspace.py:1127` |
| `.charter/unrecorded/<sha256(realpath(tree))[:32]>.json` | Clone state, rebuildable | `{"errno": …, "says": …}` for a marker publish that failed | stable — `doctor` reads it in another process; recomputed on the next failed publish | `charter/workspace.py:2960`, written `charter/workspace.py:2977` |
| `.charter/workspace-rename.json` | Clone state, transient | **purlis only** (charter#367). `{"from": <old>, "to": <new>, "moved": <bool>}`, JSON, 0600, replaced whole by `rewrite::replace`: the journal of a `purlis workspace rename` in progress. Written before `workspaces/<old>` is renamed, marked `moved` right after (the commit point), and removed once every record that names the workspace has followed. While one that got past the commit point is there, every other rename is refused and the same rename finishes it. One that never moved is stale and the next rename replaces it | stable — a second process (the next rename) reads what the first wrote; deleting it after the move leaves the records the rename had not reached yet naming the old name | `crates/purlis-core/src/wscmd/rename.rs` |
| `.charter/ws-autosave/<ws>` | Clone state, transient, legacy | debounce marker (mtime + a float) for the Stop-hook autosave | internal — deleting it costs one extra commit attempt | `charter/commands_workspace.py:1171`, written `charter/commands_workspace.py:1179` |

Resolution order (`workspace.chosen`, `charter/workspace.py:615`–`649`, and `resolve`
adding the built-in fallback, `charter/workspace.py:586`):
`--workspace` → `$CHARTER_WORKSPACE` (stripped; whitespace-only is unset,
`charter/workspace.py:550`) → **the tree you stand in** (`from_path`,
`charter/workspace.py:348`) → `.charter/sessions/<sid>.workspace` → the frame's launch record
(`for_frame`, `charter/workspace.py:114`) → `.charter/terminals/<tid>.workspace` →
`workspaces/.default` → `config.DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` (`[workspace] default`, fallback
`"default"`, `charter/config.py:31`, `charter/config.py:734`). Pointers older than 30 days
are pruned from both directories on every `set_active` (`charter/workspace.py:45`,
`charter/workspace.py:881`).

**The Rust purlis has every rung of this ladder but the frame's launch record**, because
`.charter/frame/**` is the tmux frame's and that binary neither reads nor writes there (the
ruling above). The two can therefore answer differently in exactly one state — a chat the frame
launched, with no session pointer yet — where the Rust side falls through to
`.charter/terminals/<tid>.workspace` and below. ADR 0032 records the decision, what an operator
on a frame-driven plane sees until then, and the one command that closes it.

**Two more differences, both purlis's own (SI-1, 2026-09-26):**

- **`workspaces/<ws>` itself is in `<ws>`.** Python's `from_path` counts only a path with
  something under the workspace (the directory itself is "a container and not a tree"), so a
  session standing in `workspaces/<ws>` fell through to the pointers. The app starts a
  workspace's chats in exactly that directory and files them under that workspace, so the
  Rust cwd rung counts it (`active::workspace_of_tree`, which `Plane::workspace_of` now calls).
  The recorded scenario `workspace-the-workspace-directory-itself-is-in-that-workspace` holds
  the new answer.
- **`$CHARTER_PLANE_ROOT_SESSION=1` puts a session in no workspace.** Asked before the ladder:
  when it is exactly `1` and neither `--workspace` nor a non-blank `$CHARTER_WORKSPACE` names a
  workspace, a command that needs one refuses with a sentence telling the caller to pass `-w`,
  `workspace current` prints nothing and fails, `workspace use` and `workspace create --use` are
  refused, `recall` searches every base but a workspace's, and `status` reports every
  workspace with none marked. Any other value changes nothing. The ladder itself is unchanged.
- **Standing in the plane outside every workspace is the plane root too** (SI-1b,
  2026-09-27). A session whose directory is the plane's or anywhere under it that is no
  workspace's (`docs/`, `.charter/`, `workspaces/` itself), and for which no rung that speaks
  for THAT session answers — no `--workspace`, no `$CHARTER_WORKSPACE`, no tree, neither its
  session pointer nor its terminal pointer — is in no workspace, with every answer of the
  bullet above but one: `workspace use` and `workspace create --use` still work, because
  nothing pinned it there, and from then on its session pointer answers. **The two committed
  defaults, `workspaces/.default` and `[workspace] default`, no longer answer for such a
  session.** They are the plane's answer for a caller that is nowhere — a script run from
  outside the plane with `$CHARTER_ROOT` set — and they still answer there, and still end the
  ladder asked on its own (`active::workspace`); a session standing in the plane is somewhere,
  and the window already filed it on the plane root's tab. The pointers stay above it so a
  session that was never pinned to the root keeps moving with `workspace use`. Python answered
  the plane's default here; the recorded scenarios that stood at the plane root with no pointer
  and needed a workspace hold the new answer, and each says so in its notes.
  (`active::plane_root`, the one question every command, hook and the footer asks.)

## Personas, memory and the roster

The modules that own this area: `charter/persona.py`, `charter/memstore.py`,
`charter/recall.py`, `charter/curate.py`, `charter/commands_persona.py`,
`charter/dispatch.py`, `charter/skilluse.py`, `charter/report.py`.

Plane roots used below (`charter/config.py:819`, `:824`, `:828`, `:834`, `:36`):

| Global | Value |
|---|---|
| `PERSONAS_DIR` | `<plane>/personas` — `charter/config.py:819` |
| `SHARED_PERSONA` | `_shared` — `charter/config.py:36` |
| `PERSONA_STATE_DIR` | `<plane>/.charter/persona-state` — `charter/config.py:824` |
| `ACTIVE_PERSONA_FILE` | `<plane>/.charter/active-persona` — `charter/config.py:828` |
| `REPORTS_DIR` | `<plane>/.charter/reports` — `charter/config.py:834` |

A persona name is `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`, matched with `fullmatch`
(`charter/persona.py:47`, `charter/persona.py:78`). A leading `_` is reserved for purlis's
own namespaces (`_shared`, `_dispatch`, `_skills`) and `list_personas` skips any directory
starting with `_` (`charter/persona.py:234`).

**In charter-app** the name `charter` is reserved too (`crates/purlis-core/src/personas.rs`,
`RESERVED`), because `charter/<id>` names purlis's own curation actions (ADR 0061).
`purlis persona create purlis` is refused. A persona that already has the name still loads,
runs and can be removed, but `purlis persona lint` reports it as an error and none of its
curation actions is offered.

---

### `personas/`

- **Format:** directory.
- **Status:** stable — committed; the operator creates personas here by hand or with
  `purlis persona create`; every process (CLI, hooks, status line, frame) enumerates it.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:2651` (`_ensure_front_door`, `purlis init`),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:110` (`cmd_persona_create`), `charter/persona.py:2493`
  (`migrate`).
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:225` (`list_personas`) — the roster every other surface
  starts from: `charter/statusline.py:1779`, `charter/render.py:95`, `charter/doctor.py`,
  `charter/frame/switch.py`, `charter/report.py:169` (scrub), `charter/hooks.py:8138`.
- **Git:** committed. Nothing in `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE` (`charter/commands.py:1087`) covers
  `personas/`; verified with `git check-ignore` on the live plane (exit 1 = not ignored).
- **Encoding details:** membership = a subdirectory holding `persona.md`, not starting with
  `_` (`charter/persona.py:234`), plus legacy flat `personas/*.md` whose stem is not
  `readme` (case-insensitive, `charter/persona.py:230`). `list_personas` returns a sorted
  list of names.

---

### `personas/<name>/persona.md`

- **Format:** Markdown with a minimal, line-based frontmatter block (NOT YAML: no parser,
  no quote stripping, no nesting, no comments).
- **Status:** stable — hand-edited, committed, and read by the tool gate, the status line,
  hooks and the app. **Not read by a sub-agent generator any more** (#1451): a persona runs
  as its own chat and purlis generates no sub-agent from this file. The keys that only fed
  the generated file are marked **retired** in the table below.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by (purlis, #1449):** the persona's view in the app, which sets or removes the
  `icon` and `color` lines and leaves every other line as it was
  (`crates/purlis-core/src/personamark.rs` `set`): one atomic replace, no link followed. A
  key already there keeps its place; a new one goes last in the frontmatter.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands_persona.py:123` (`cmd_persona_create`, template at
  `:36`/`:57`), `charter/commands.py:2677` (`_ensure_front_door`, template at
  `charter/commands.py:2597`), `charter/persona.py:2504` (`migrate` renames the legacy flat
  file here). Plain `Path.write_text` — no atomic rename, no lock. **In purlis, also a
  project template** (FR-17, `crates/purlis-core/src/template.rs` `apply`): each template's
  two personas (`<stack>-engineer` and `<stack>-reviewer`; `docs-writer` and `docs-reviewer`
  for docs only), with `memory/.gitkeep` and `refs/.gitkeep`, only when the persona's
  directory is not there at all, and each file only when it is absent. No sub-agent file is
  written for them, by a template or by `persona create` (#1451). They declare
  `name, role, vault: none, delegate-when` and no `tools`, so a template grants nothing the
  plane-trust fingerprint would ask about.
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:456` (`load`) is the single reader; through it
  `resolve` (`:872`), `lineage` (`:839`), `tools_of` (`:1580`), `effective_tools` (`:1691`),
  `vault_of` (`:2240`), `is_draft` (`:1846`), `declared_skills` (`:1957`), `routing_level`
  (`:939`), `routes_to` (`:962`), `lint` (`:2018`); `charter/toolgate.py:896`
  (PreToolUse gate), `charter/commands_persona.py:867` (`_render_agent`),
  `charter/hooks.py:7402` (SessionStart identity block), `charter/statusline.py`,
  `charter/render.py:97`, `charter/doctor.py`.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:**
  - Frontmatter is parsed only when the file **starts with** `---`; `text.split("---", 2)`
    must yield ≥3 parts (`charter/persona.py:258`-`:260`). `parts[1]` is the frontmatter,
    `parts[2]` the body (stripped, `:268`).
  - Each frontmatter line: skipped if it has no `:`; `key, _, value = line.partition(":")`;
    both sides `.strip()`ed; empty key skipped (`charter/persona.py:261`-`:267`). Quotes are
    **kept** as part of the value (`charter/persona.py:95`).
  - Order is preserved as pairs and then collapsed to a dict — **last line wins** for a
    repeated key, and the duplicate is reported as an error (`charter/persona.py:489`,
    `charter/persona.py:355`).
  - Keys are matched **exactly**; a key differing only by case is an error and blocks agent
    generation (`charter/persona.py:329`, `charter/commands_persona.py:1127`). Unknown keys
    are a lint warning only (`charter/persona.py:2100`).
  - List-valued keys are comma-separated; `_csv_list` strips a surrounding `[…]` and each
    item (`charter/persona.py:510`).
  - `name` defaults to the directory name when absent (`charter/persona.py:484`).
  - Writer's key order (create): `name, role, vault, [extends], [delegate-when], draft`
    (`charter/commands_persona.py:36`, `:113`, `:118` — `extends` is spliced after `vault`,
    then `delegate-when` after `vault` too, so `extends` ends up above `delegate-when`;
    confirmed by running `persona create --extends`). Front door order:
    `name, role, vault, routing, delegate-when` (`charter/commands.py:2597`); purlis's
    `init` writes `name, role, vault, delegate-when`, since `routing` is retired (charter#369).
  - Body: everything after the closing `---`, stripped.

Full frontmatter vocabulary — `KNOWN_KEYS = AGENT_PASSTHROUGH_KEYS | CHARTER_OWN_KEYS`
(`charter/persona.py:305`, `charter/persona.py:309`, `charter/persona.py:322`). Every value
is a string; "type" below is how purlis interprets it.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | defaults to directory name | Identity; emitted as the agent's `name:` | stable | `charter/persona.py:484`, `charter/commands_persona.py:870` |
| `role` | string (one line) | none; `lint` warns | Human role; in listings, the agent description and the session identity block | stable | `charter/commands_persona.py:779`, `charter/persona.py:2068` |
| `vault` | string, or the reserved `none` | none; `lint` warns; falls back to a vault tagged with the persona name | Which vault this persona's secrets live in. `none` = deliberately holds none → `vault_of` returns `None` | stable | `charter/persona.py:2218`, `:2240`, `:2221` |
| `extends` | one persona name | absent | Parent whose purlis+tools are inherited; chain resolved root→child, cycle-safe | stable | `charter/persona.py:839`, `:872` |
| `uses` | CSV of persona names | absent | Routing edge; legacy grant (vault + tools + delegation) when `borrows:` is absent | stable | `charter/persona.py:1587`, `:1691` |
| `borrows` | CSV of persona names, or `none` | **absent ≠ empty**: absent = legacy `uses:` grant, `none`/unreadable = nothing | Which personas' tools the gate auto-approves | stable | `charter/persona.py:1656`, `:1597`, `:1616` |
| `delegate-when` | prose (one line) | none; `lint` warns; `create` requires it unless `--extends` | Routing trigger: what work belongs to this persona. Quoted to a chat that runs as it and shown in its view. (It was the generated agent's description until #1451) | stable | `charter/commands_persona.py:780`, `:806` |
| `description` | string | absent | **The persona's one-line description** (#1451), where `agent-description` is absent: quoted to a chat that runs as the persona (the session briefing's `> description:` line) and shown by `persona show` (`about:`). Inherited along `extends`. It was the generated agent's description override | stable | `charter/commands_persona.py:869` |
| `agent-description` | string | absent | The persona's one-line description, read before `description` (#1451). It was the generated agent's description override (wins) | stable | `charter/commands_persona.py:869` |
| `tools` | CSV of program names | absent = none | Programs auto-approved by the PreToolUse gate while active; unioned along `extends`. **purlis:** only as approved on this machine, since the grant is part of the plane-trust fingerprint (ADR 0035, *Grants*) with a digest of any `bin/` script a tool names; a grant that changed since prompts until the plane is approved again | stable | `charter/persona.py:1580`, `charter/toolgate.py:896` |
| `agent-tools` | CSV of harness tool names | absent | **Retired in purlis (#1451): read by nothing.** It was the generated sub-agent's `tools:` allow-list, and a persona chat has every tool of its harness: a persona that listed no editing tool could not edit files as a sub-agent and can as a chat. `persona lint` and the `persona-agents` fix say what widened and leave the line. To deny a persona's chats a tool, name it in `disallowed-tools`. An allow-list for one persona's chats: #1460 | retired |
| `disallowed-tools` | CSV of the harness's own tool rules (`Write`, `Bash(git push:*)`) | absent | **Honoured for a persona chat on Claude Code** (#1451, D-1451-18): each entry is a deny rule of the chat's own `--settings`, which outranks every allow. Inherited along `extends`, child wins. **Fail closed elsewhere**: on Codex and opencode purlis cannot deny a chat a tool, so a chat as a persona that declares the key is not started there and a dispatch to it is refused, each with a sentence (`personaverbs::chatstart::unenforced`, asked by `start::ready` and `personaprofile::for_dispatch`). It was the generated sub-agent's `disallowedTools:` | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/personaverbs/chatstart.rs`, `harness/claude.rs` `settings` |
| `skills` | CSV of `[plugin:]skill` | absent | The persona's declared skills, which `persona stats` compares with the skills it used. **No chat preloads them** (retired in that sense, #1451): they were preloaded into the generated sub-agent. `persona lint` and the `persona-agents` fix say so and leave the line, and lint no longer checks them against installed skills. Preloading into a persona chat: #1460 | retired in a chat | `charter/persona.py:1957`, `charter/commands_persona.py:908` |
| `draft` | `true/yes/1/on` (case-insensitive) truthy set | absent = not a draft | While set, the charter is unfinished: `persona lint`, `persona stats` and the doctor say so, and no chat is dispatched to the persona. (Until #1451 it also meant no sub-agent was generated) | stable | `charter/persona.py:1843`, `:1846`, `charter/commands_persona.py:1150` |
| `routing` | `off` \| `advise` \| `require` | absent/unknown → `off` | Drove the Python's UserPromptSubmit roster block. **Retired** in purlis (charter#369): read without error, acted on by nothing, and `purlis doctor` names the personas that still declare it. Work for another persona goes to a chat of its own, by dispatch (#1434) | retired | `charter/persona.py:936`, `:939`, `charter/hooks.py:8518` |
| `routes-to` | CSV of persona names | absent | Priority order for the roster (never restricts). **Retired** with `routing` — there is no roster | retired | `charter/persona.py:962`, `:1001` |
| `activity` | `orchestrator` \| `standby` \| `advisory` | absent | Declares memory volume is not a usage signal; changes `persona stats` status | stable | `charter/persona.py:2408`, `:2444` |
| `dispatch-isolation` | `worktree` | absent | It emitted `isolation: worktree` into the generated sub-agent, which purlis no longer generates (#1451). **In purlis** (#1453): the persona's default place to work when a dispatch to it names none — its chat gets a worktree of its own, cut by the app off the repo the asking chat works in, and works in the asking chat's folder where that chat works in no repo. Read with the persona's chain applied. A dispatch's own `--in` wins over it | stable | `charter/commands_persona.py:802`, `:916`; `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchplace.rs` `isolates` |
| `wants` | CSV of persona names, the brackets optional (`wants: [devops, qa]`) | absent = nothing offered | **purlis only** (#1502, spec #1483; V100-20, V100-21; ADR 0090 as amended 2026-10-08). **The personas this one usually works with. It grants nothing, ever**: who may dispatch to whom stays in `[dispatch.grants]` and this machine's record, and nothing that decides a dispatch reads this key, so a persona that wants another is asked exactly as one that does not, and a chat nobody is at is refused as before. **A chat can write persona definitions** (its own persona's, and at the project's root any persona's, new ones included), so the line is treated as an offer a chat may have written, and gives no reach. It is read for the dispatch question alone: under its answers the Notice offers one box per wanted persona that nothing answers for yet ("Also let steward dispatch to:"), **unticked**, in alphabetical order, each with what that persona works with; an Allow keeps the asked pair and each ticked one for the same people as the answer pressed, each as its own audited grant. Offered: a persona's name as purlis mints one, of at most 40 characters, that is a persona of this project whose definition loads, not a `draft`, not a name purlis keeps for itself, and not the persona itself. **Ignored, and said by `purlis persona lint` (so counted by `purlis doctor`)**: a name no persona has, one whose definition does not load, a draft, a reserved name, the persona itself, `*` ("any persona" is granted in Settings only), anything that is not a persona's name or is too long, and every entry past the first 6 offered. Not offered either: a pair a grant covers, one you said never to, one policy locks, one you kept blocked in that chat, one with a question of its own waiting, and any at all while this machine's list of nevers does not read. Inherited along `extends`, the child's line replacing its parent's whole; lint says whose line it is. The definition is read when the question is raised and again when it is answered: only a name still offered then is granted, and an answer to a question that reads differently than it was shown grants nothing | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/dispatchwants.rs` |
| `profile` | the name of a harness profile, or the reserved `none` | absent = a chat dispatched to this persona starts on the asking chat's profile | **purlis only** (#1445). The profile this persona's chats start on: what the new-chat picker starts on when the persona is picked, and what a chat handed to it starts on, on whatever harness that profile runs. A name, never a command: it is only looked up among the profiles the project offers on this machine. **Only a built-in's name (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`) or a declared harness's travels with the project**; a local profile's name is one machine's. Where the name is not offered on a machine, a chat handed to the persona starts on the asking chat's profile there, and the dispatch's answer, the new chat's stamp and the persona view say so. A profile that is offered and whose command has not been approved on that machine starts nothing. `none` names no profile, for a persona that would otherwise inherit one, so no profile called `none` can be named. Inherited along `extends`. Claude Code, Codex and opencode profiles are tested | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/personaprofile.rs` `named_by`, `for_dispatch` |
| `model` | string | absent | **purlis:** where `profile` is absent and the project offers a profile of exactly this name, it names that profile; any other value is read by nothing (#1451: it was passed verbatim into the generated agent's frontmatter). The `persona-agents` fix rewrites the line to `profile:` where it is read as one and the profile travels with the project (a built-in or a declared harness the project offers on that machine, and no definition of the `extends` chain has a `profile:` line). Otherwise it and `persona lint` report it, with what follows: **a chat as that persona runs on the asking chat's profile and model** (D-1451-20) | retired, but for the profile it may name | `charter/persona.py:305`, `charter/commands_persona.py:953` |
| `color` | a palette name (`red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`) or `#rrggbb` | absent = a colour of the palette picked by the persona's name | **The persona's colour**, which its mark is drawn on wherever the persona appears in the app (#1449): a workspace's vocabulary (`settings.theme.colour`), and a hue of the theme drawn. Inherited along `extends`, child wins. A value that is neither is not drawn, and the persona's view and `persona lint` say so. No longer copied anywhere: the generated agent is retired (#1451). The `persona-agents` fix rewrites the two names Claude Code used that this palette spells otherwise (`cyan` to `teal`, `magenta` to `pink`) | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/personamark.rs` (`mark`); `charter/persona.py:305` |
| `icon` | one of purlis's persona icons, by name | absent = the persona's initials | **The persona's icon** (#1449): `anchor`, `book`, `bot`, `briefcase`, `bug`, `chart`, `clipboard`, `cloud`, `code`, `compass`, `cpu`, `database`, `eye`, `flask`, `git-branch`, `globe`, `graduation-cap`, `hammer`, `heart`, `key`, `leaf`, `lightbulb`, `lock`, `mail`, `map`, `megaphone`, `package`, `palette`, `pen`, `rocket`, `scale`, `search`, `server`, `shield`, `star`, `terminal`, `user`, `users`, `wrench`, `zap`. A name, never a path. Inherited along `extends`, child wins. Another value is not drawn, and the persona's view says so. A custom image in the folder is drawn instead (`icon.png` below) | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/personamark.rs` (`ICONS`, `mark`) |
| `memory` | string (truthy) | absent | **Retired in purlis (#1451): read by nothing.** It chose the harness's own memory store for the generated sub-agent and added a note to its body. A persona chat has the persona's memory in `personas/<name>/memory/`. `persona lint` and the `persona-agents` fix say so and leave the line. Choosing a harness store for a persona chat: #1460 | retired | `charter/commands_persona.py:962` |

Inheritance merge (`charter/persona.py:872`-`:909`): iterate the chain root→child; every
truthy scalar key overwrites (child wins, `:892`); `tools`, `agent-tools`, `uses` are
order-preserving unions, parent first, deduped, and `uses` drops self (`:894`-`:896`);
`extends` itself is not copied into the merged meta; charters are concatenated, each
non-root ancestor's body prefixed with
`\n\n---\n\n### ⤷ \`{child}\` extends \`{parent}\` — its own charter\n\n` (`:900`);
`meta["name"]` is forced back to the queried name (`:905`); merged list keys are re-joined
with `", "` (`:907`-`:908`).

### `personas/<name>.md` (legacy flat layout)

- **Format:** same file as above, one level up.
- **Status:** stable — still resolved for read on old checkouts.
- **Tier:** Plane, legacy — committed; read on old checkouts, written by nothing.
- **Written by:** nothing any more; `charter/persona.py:2493` (`migrate`) moves it to
  `personas/<name>/persona.md` and scaffolds `memory/` + `refs/`.
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:172` (`def_path` prefers the directory layout, falls back
  here, else returns the canonical new path), `charter/persona.py:230` (`list_personas`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** identical parsing. A stem of `readme` (any case) is not a persona.

---

### `personas/<name>/memory/MEMORY.md`

- **Format:** Markdown; a header block then one link line per memory.
- **Status:** stable — committed, hand-editable, read by the SessionStart hook, `doctor`,
  `curate` and `persona recall`.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:2265` (`scaffold_memory`, header at `:2277`),
  `charter/memstore.py:138` (`index_append`, appends one line), `charter/memstore.py:472`
  (`_drop_index_line`, the only truncating write), `charter/memstore.py:86` (`ensure_index`,
  used by workspace memory; `O_EXCL` create at `:97`).
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:6823` (`_read_index` → SessionStart memory digest,
  `charter/hooks.py:6908`), `charter/memstore.py:259` (`_listed` → `index_drift` at `:217`,
  `doctor`, `curate.report` at `charter/curate.py:71`),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:1267` (`persona recall` prints it verbatim).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:**
  - Scaffold header (`charter/persona.py:2277`), exactly:
    `# Memory Index — {name|"shared (all personas)"}\n\nOne line per memory; each links a file holding a single durable fact.\nWritten by the persona as it learns; committed and shared.\n`
    — note **no blank line** between the header and the first appended entry (confirmed on
    the live plane and in a temp plane).
  - `index_append` fallback header when the file is missing: `# Memory Index\n\n`
    (`charter/memstore.py:142`).
  - Entry line: `- [{title}]({filename})\n`, appended in `"a"` mode, chronological by write
    order (`charter/memstore.py:143`-`:144`). No sorting, no dedupe.
  - Readers match `- [` prefix (`charter/hooks.py:6851`) and the link regex
    `\(([A-Za-z0-9][\w.-]*\.md)\)` (`charter/memstore.py:214`). **In purlis** a line
    starting `- [` lists only the file its leading element links, the rule the workspace index
    above records (SI-9e).
  - `MEMORY.md` is excluded from the memory-file glob by name
    (`charter/memstore.py:208`).
  - Deletion rewrites the file as the surviving lines joined with `\n` plus one trailing
    `\n` (none when empty) — `charter/memstore.py:489`-`:490`.
  - **In purlis**, an edit retitles a memory's line in place and an unarchive appends one
    back ([Editing and archiving a memory](#editing-and-archiving-a-memory-purlis)).

---

### `personas/<name>/memory/<slug>.md` (and `personas/_shared/memory/<slug>.md`)

- **Format:** Markdown; fixed 3-part shape.
- **Status:** stable — committed, shared with the team, read by every recall path and by the
  session briefing.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed. `[memory] share` decides only whether purlis commits and pushes it.
- **Written by:** `charter/memstore.py:101` (`write`) via `charter/persona.py:2298`
  (`remember`), from `purlis persona remember` (`charter/commands_persona.py:1188`).
  **In purlis, also rewritten in place** by `purlis persona edit-memory <name> <slug>
  [--shared]` and the window's memory tab (`memstore::edit`), and moved to and from `archive/`
  by `persona archive-memory|unarchive-memory` — the rules are
  [Editing and archiving a memory](#editing-and-archiving-a-memory-purlis) — and moved in
  from or out to another scope by `persona move-memory`, `workspace move-memory` and the
  window's Move ([Moving a memory between scopes](#moving-a-memory-between-scopes-purlis)).
- **Read by:** `charter/memstore.py:169`/`:197` (`files`/`read_files` — the one gate),
  `:289` (`entries`), `:367` (`search`), `:408` (`duplicates`), `:429` (`resolve`);
  `charter/persona.py:2330`/`:2356`/`:2411`; `charter/recall.py:204` (`purlis recall`);
  `charter/curate.py:38`; `charter/statusline.py:1779`; `charter/render.py:95`;
  `charter/hooks.py:6866` (digest counts).
- **Git:** committed. Whether purlis itself commits/pushes it is `[memory] share`
  (below).
- **Encoding details:**
  - Content, exactly (`charter/memstore.py:131`-`:132`):
    `# {title}\n\n_{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM} · {kind}_\n\n{text}\n`
    — `·` is U+00B7 with single spaces; `kind` is `persistent` for committed persona memory,
    `ephemeral` for scratch (`charter/persona.py:2317`).
  - Timestamp is **local, naive** `datetime.now()` (`charter/memstore.py:64`), minute
    precision. Persona memory is never `timestamped=` (no `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-` filename
    prefix) — `charter/persona.py:2320`, `charter/memstore.py:119`.
  - `text` is `.strip()`ed; empty raises `ValueError` (`charter/memstore.py:107`-`:109`).
  - Title = explicit `--title` or the first line of the body, stripped, capped at 72
    (`charter/persona.py:2315`, `charter/memstore.py:33`, `:110`).
  - Filename = `slug(title) + ".md"`; slug = lowercase, every run of non-`[a-z0-9]`
    replaced by `-`, leading/trailing `-` stripped, then **truncated to 48 chars** (so a
    trailing `-` can survive), `"note"` when empty (`charter/memstore.py:23`, `:26`-`:28`).
    Collision → `-2`, `-3`, … before `.md` (`charter/memstore.py:123`-`:124`).
  - Write goes through `config.write_for` (`charter/memstore.py:131`); outside
    `.charter/` that is a plain `open`, so the umask decides the mode. Not atomic.
    purlis (#434) replaces the file whole through `rewrite::replace` (temp beside,
    fsync, rename), under the store's own mode rules, and never writes through a link at
    the file; the index's line removal is replaced the same way.
  - Date used by `stats`/`recall --since`: in-body `_YYYY-MM-DD` stamp
    (`^_(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})[ T]`, multiline — `charter/memstore.py:147`), falling back to a
    `YYYYMMDD-` filename prefix (`:160`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `# <title>` line | first `# ` line | required (written always) | Title used by index, search (3× weight) and `entries` | stable | `charter/memstore.py:132`, `:325` |
| `_<stamp> · <kind>_` line | `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M` + kind | required (written always) | Recording date; `kind` ∈ `persistent`/`ephemeral` | stable | `charter/memstore.py:132`, `charter/persona.py:2317` |
| body | free Markdown | required, non-empty | The fact | stable | `charter/memstore.py:107` |

### `personas/<name>/memory/archive/<slug>.md`

- **Format:** same memory file, moved.
- **Status:** stable — committed; a reversible retire that drops the memory out of every
  glob (the glob is flat, so `archive/` is invisible to `files()`).
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/memstore.py:503` (`archive`) via `charter/curate.py:92`
  (`apply_safe`, exact-duplicate collapse) — reached by `purlis persona optimize --apply`.
  **In purlis, also** `persona archive-memory` / `workspace archive` and the window's
  Delete (`memstore::archive_one`), and emptied back into the store by `unarchive-memory` /
  `workspace unarchive`, the window's Undo and its archive tab's Restore memory
  (`memstore::unarchive`) —
  [Editing and archiving a memory](#editing-and-archiving-a-memory-purlis).
- **Read by:** nothing in purlis (deliberately out of the active set); git history and
  humans only. In purlis, `memstore::unarchive` reads the one file it restores, and the
  window's archive tab lists and shows the store's `archive/`, read-only
  (`Persona::archived_memories` / `Workspace::archived_memories`, KN-4) — never in a briefing,
  a recall or a memory list.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** `rename` into `<mem_dir>/archive/`, created with `mkdir_for`;
  collision → `<stem>-2.md` (`charter/memstore.py:521`-`:523`); the index line is dropped
  (`:525`).

---

### `personas/<name>/memory/.gitkeep`, `personas/<name>/refs/.gitkeep`

- **Format:** empty file.
- **Status:** stable — committed, and the only reason an empty `memory/`/`refs/` survives a
  clone. (A front-door persona has these and **no** `MEMORY.md`/`README.md`.)
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:2680` (`_ensure_front_door`, `purlis init` only).
- **Read by:** nothing (`files()` filters to `*.md`, `charter/memstore.py:208`).
- **Git:** committed.

---

### `personas/<name>/refs/README.md` and `personas/<name>/refs/**`

- **Format:** Markdown documents, arbitrarily nested.
- **Status:** stable — committed curated docs; `purlis recall` reads them as a default
  scope; the operator writes them by hand.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:2283`-`:2291` (`scaffold_memory` writes only
  `README.md`); everything else is hand-written, except that **in purlis a project
  template** (FR-17) writes `personas/<stack>-reviewer/refs/REVIEW.md`, the checklist its
  reviewer persona reviews by, when it makes that persona. It is the plane's copy: nothing is
  written into a repo.
- **Read by:** `charter/recall.py:128`-`:133` + `:142` (`_ref_dirs`, recursive: every
  subdirectory is offered as its own source because `memstore.files` is a flat glob);
  `charter/commands_persona.py:322` (`persona show` counts refs, excluding `README.md`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** `README.md` scaffold text at `charter/persona.py:2287`-`:2291`:
  `# References — {who}\n\nCurated docs, links, and snippets this role collects. Committed and shared. Never store secrets here — those live only in the vault.\n`.
  Refs are read as memory files (`*.md`, `MEMORY.md` excluded), so an `# ` heading is the
  title and a `_date_` line, if present, is the date.

---

### `personas/<name>/mcp.json`

- **Format:** JSON — `.mcp.json`'s schema plus charter-only `secrets` / `secret_files` maps
  per server.
- **Status:** stable — committed, hand-written (often pasted from a server's README), read
  by the chat's start, `lint`, `persona use`, `persona approve-mcp` and the `persona-agents`
  fix. **In purlis a chat that runs as the persona is started with these servers on Claude
  Code** (#1451, D-1451-17), on the `--mcp-config` that carries purlis's own server, for that
  chat alone (`personaverbs::chatstart::servers`, `harness/claude.rs`). They were declared in
  the generated sub-agent, which is retired. A server that declares `secrets` or
  `secret_files` is started only wrapped in `purlis secret exec <vault> …`, run by purlis's
  own binary, and only once this machine approved its line (`mcp-approved.json`); one nobody
  approved is **withheld**, not started without its credential, and the chat's briefing says
  which. A server named like purlis's own (`purlis`) is refused. **On Codex and opencode the
  servers are not started**, and the briefing and `lint` say so.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** nothing in purlis — hand-edited only.
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:653` (`_mcp_declared`) → `mcp_servers` (`:622`),
  `mcp_refused` (`:641`), `mcp_credentialed` (`:799`), `mcp_withheld` (`:832`),
  `mcp_render_entry` (`:730`); `charter/commands_persona.py:876`/`:926` (render),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:1996` (`--approve-mcp`), `charter/persona.py:2114` (`lint`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:**
  - Only `doc["mcpServers"]` is read and it must be a dict; any `OSError`/`ValueError` is
    swallowed and the file skipped (`charter/persona.py:673`-`:677`).
  - Unioned along the `extends` chain **reversed** (parent first, child wins) —
    `charter/persona.py:667`.
  - Server names are bounded at the boundary: `[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}`, `fullmatch`
    (`charter/persona.py:549`, `:552`). A refused name drops the server and is reported as a
    lint error.
  - Rendering (`charter/persona.py:730`): `secrets`/`secret_files` keys are removed from the
    emitted entry; with a real vault (`vault: none` → no vault, `:689`) **and** a recorded
    approval (`charter/mcpseen.py`), the entry becomes
    `command: "purlis"`, `args: ["secret","exec",<vault>, "--env","NAME=key"…, "--file","NAME=key"…, "--stream"|"--exec", "--", <original command>, *<original args>]`
    (`charter/persona.py:781`-`:794`). `--stream` whenever any `secret_files` is present.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mcpServers` | object | required (else no servers) | Map of server name → entry | stable | `charter/persona.py:674` |
| `mcpServers.<name>` | string key | must match `_MCP_NAME_RE` | Server name; also interpolated into `mcp__<name>__*` | stable | `charter/persona.py:549`, `charter/commands_persona.py:890` |
| `…command`, `…args`, `…env`, any other key | as `.mcp.json` | passed through | Emitted verbatim into the agent (all unknown keys are kept) | stable | `charter/persona.py:747` |
| `…secrets` | `{ENV_VAR: vault-key}` | optional | Vault value injected as an env var | stable | `charter/persona.py:751`, `:782`-`:783` |
| `…secret_files` | `{ENV_VAR: vault-key}` | optional | Vault value materialised to a 0600 file whose path is the env var | stable | `charter/persona.py:758`, `:784`-`:785` |

### `personas/<name>/icon.png`

- **Format:** a PNG image.
- **Status:** stable — optional, hand-placed, committed.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** nothing in purlis — hand-placed only.
- **Read by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/personamark.rs` (`mark`), for the app: the persona's
  mark on its chats' tabs, the explorer, the Personas panel, its view, needs-you items,
  Notices and the new-chat picker (#1449).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:**
  - The persona's own folder only: an image is not inherited along `extends`. It is drawn
    instead of the `icon:` its definition names.
  - At most 64 KB, a plain file, with no link on the way. A longer file is not read.
  - **Untrusted**, since a chat can edit its own persona's folder. It must start with the PNG
    signature. It reaches the window as bytes and is decoded onto a canvas: it is never put in
    the page as markup and never loaded from a URL.
  - An image that is refused, or that the window cannot decode, draws the persona's initials,
    and the persona's view says why.
  - **An `icon.svg` is not drawn and never read.** purlis notices the file by its name only.
    With no `icon.png` beside it, the persona keeps its `icon:` or its initials, and its view
    says: *purlis draws a custom persona icon from icon.png. Save this image as a PNG.*

---

### `personas/<name>/bin/<script>`

- **Format:** any executable file.
- **Status:** stable — committed, hand-written, run by the dispatched agent by path and
  vouched for by the Bash tool gate.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** nothing in purlis.
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:580` (`bin_scripts`, union along the reversed lineage,
  executable files only), `charter/persona.py:610` (`bin_issues` — a non-executable file is
  a lint warning), `charter/commands_persona.py:978`-`:1010` (the "You carry your own
  executables" block in the generated agent), `charter/toolgate.py` (inode check for a path
  in command position).
- **Git:** committed, mode bit included.
- **Encoding details:** flat `sorted(d.iterdir())` per ancestor; only `f.is_file() and
  os.access(f, os.X_OK)` counts (`charter/persona.py:604`-`:606`). `uses:`/`borrows:` do
  **not** carry scripts. Paths are rendered plane-relative in the agent
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:858`, `:1003`).

---

### `personas/<name>/curation/<id>.md` — a curation action

New in purlis (ADR 0061); the Python charter never read or wrote it. A **curation action**
is a chat the operator can open on a workspace, a persona or the plane with a prompt already
typed into it and never sent. This file declares one, and the persona it sits under is the one
that runs it.

- **Format:** Markdown with the same line-based frontmatter as
  [`persona.md`](#personasnamepersonamd) (`crates/purlis-core/src/personas.rs`,
  `frontmatter` and `charter_body`: not YAML, quotes kept, a key matched exactly). The body
  below the frontmatter is the prompt template.
- **Status:** stable — hand-edited, committed, and read by the app's menus and by
  `purlis curation show`.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** the operator by hand, or `purlis persona curation add <name> <id>`, which
  writes it only when it would read back without an error and never over an existing file.
  Removed by `purlis persona curation remove <name> <id>`, and with the whole persona by
  `purlis persona remove`.
- **Read by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/curation.rs` (`declared`, `resolve`, `lint`), which
  `purlis persona curation list`, `purlis curation show` and `purlis persona lint` all
  call.
- **Git:** committed, like everything else under `personas/<name>/`.
- **Encoding details:**
  - `<id>` is the file's stem and must be a name purlis could mint, the persona-name grammar
    `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`. The action's full id is `<name>/<id>`. purlis's own built-in
    actions are `charter/<id>` and are not files at all: they ship inside the binary.
  - Only `*.md` files directly under `curation/` are actions. A dotfile (`.gitkeep`) or a
    subdirectory is not one and is not reported.
  - A file that is not UTF-8, is larger than a memory file may be, or resolves out of the plane
    is an error, not an action.
  - `extends:` does not carry curation actions. Each persona offers only the files in its own
    `curation/`.
  - **The template** substitutes exactly four variables: `{subject.kind}` (`workspace`,
    `persona` or `plane`), `{subject.name}`, `{subject.path}` (the workspace's directory, the
    persona's directory, or the plane root) and `{plane.root}`. Substitution is one plain
    pass: a substituted value is never read again for variables, nothing is expanded by a
    shell, and no environment variable, vault or secret is ever read. Any other
    `{word}` — braces around letters, digits, `_`, `.` or `-` — is an error, so a typo is
    caught rather than typed into a chat. Braces around anything else (`{"a": 1}`) are text.
    `{{` is a literal `{` and `}}` a literal `}`, in the same pass, as in Rust's `format!` and
    Python's `str.format`: `{{word}}` types `{word}`, and `{{{subject.name}}}` types the name
    in braces. A single `}` on its own stays text, as it always was.
  - **An action that has an error is not offered**, and the list that leaves it out says so
    with a warning naming the file. So is one whose id or label is one of purlis's built-in
    actions' (`charter/safe-remove`, `charter/compact`, `charter/add-curation-action`; labels
    compared case-insensitively): a built-in cannot be overridden or impersonated. Nor is any
    action of a persona named `charter`, whose ids would read `charter/<id>`; the name is
    reserved (see [`personas/`](#personas)).
  - **Keep the prompt to one short line.** It is typed to be read before the operator presses
    Enter, and a harness draws a longer paste as a placeholder nobody can read: Claude Code
    2.1.283 over 800 characters or at 4 lines, Codex 0.147.0 over 1,000 characters, opencode
    1.18.32 over 150 characters or at 3 lines (ADR 0061, amended 2026-09-27). Such a prompt is
    still a valid action — the file format does not change — but `purlis persona lint` warns
    about it, naming the harness, and the app opens no chat for it on that harness. The lint
    renders the prompt for a subject with a long name (`LONG_SUBJECT_NAME`, 43 characters) on
    each kind in `on`. Name a skill in the prompt and let the skill hold the steps, as
    purlis's own three do.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | string (one line) | required, non-empty | What the menu and the palette show | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/curation.rs` |
| `on` | CSV of `workspace`, `persona`, `plane` | required, at least one; an unknown kind is an error | The kinds of subject the action is offered on | stable | same |
| `runs-in` | `subject` \| `plane` | absent → a workspace subject runs in its directory, a persona or the plane at the plane root; an unknown value is an error | The directory the chat starts in. `subject` is the subject's own directory (the workspace's, `personas/<name>/`, or the plane root) | stable | same |

An unknown key is a warning, as it is in `persona.md`, and a repeated key is an error.

### `personas/_shared/` (`memory/`, `refs/`)

- **Format:** exactly the per-persona `memory/` and `refs/` above.
- **Status:** stable — committed cross-persona namespace.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:2294` (`ensure_shared` → `scaffold_memory(..., shared=True)`),
  reached from `persona create` (`charter/commands_persona.py:125`) and `persona migrate`
  (`:1842`); memories by `purlis persona remember --shared`.
- **Read by:** `charter/recall.py:124` (`shared` scope, default-on), `:132` (`refs:shared`),
  `charter/hooks.py:6910` (shared half of the SessionStart digest),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:1259` (`persona recall`), `persona stats _shared` /
  `persona optimize` (`charter/commands_persona.py:1571`, `:1757`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** index header says `# Memory Index — shared (all personas)`
  (`charter/persona.py:2276`). `_shared` is outside the persona alphabet on purpose, so no
  persona can take the name; `list_personas` never returns it.

---

### `personas/.default` (legacy)

- **Format:** plain text — one persona name plus optional whitespace.
- **Status:** stable — committed, hand-written, read on every turn by the persona resolver.
- **Tier:** Plane, legacy — committed, and still read.
- **Written by:** nothing writes it any more; `purlis persona default --clear` unlinks it
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:580`).
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:915` (`default_persona`) → `_resolved` (`:1407`),
  `plane_default` (`:1058`).
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** read, `.strip()`ed; the value must pass `reference_ok` **and** the
  persona's definition file must exist, else the rung resolves to nothing
  (`charter/persona.py:930`). Ranked **below** `charter.toml` `[persona] default`
  (`charter/persona.py:1404`-`:1409`).

### `personas/_dispatch/<YYYY-MM>.<device>.jsonl`

- **Format:** JSON Lines, append-only; one object per line.
- **Status:** stable — committed (so the tally merges across machines), and read by the CLI
  (`persona stats`, the README roster). `persona stats` adds this machine's dispatch records
  to its count (`app/dispatches/<id>.json`, #1452); the README roster reads the committed
  log alone, so it is the same on every machine. **In purlis the two hook rows are no longer written**
  (#1451): the plain `{"agent", "ts"}` row of a returned `Task`/`Agent` call and the
  `resume` row of a `SendMessage` each said which persona was sent out as a sub-agent, which
  a persona never is now. The rows a log already holds are still read and counted. The
  `handoff` row is still written, by the app that opens the chat. A dispatch's own record
  is the app's (#1452).
- **Tier:** Plane — committed, so the tally merges across machines.
- **Written by:** `charter/dispatch.py:65` (`record`), `:98` (`record_advice`), `:134`
  (`record_resume`), `:170` (`record_handoff`) — driven by
  `charter/hooks.py:8170` (PostToolUse Task/Agent), `charter/hooks.py:8141` (PostToolUse
  SendMessage), `charter/hooks.py:8518` (UserPromptSubmit roster block),
  `charter/commands_handoff.py:261`.
- **Read by:** `charter/dispatch.py:322` (`_read_all`, memoised per file by
  `(mtime_ns, size)` at `:261`) → `tally` (`:343`), `last_seen` (`:354`), `advice_tally`
  (`:118`), `resume_tally` (`:208`), `generic_share` (`:368`),
  `routed_since_first_advice` (`:222`); `charter/persona.py:1061` (`_dispatches` → `by_use`
  → status line and frame switcher), `charter/commands_persona.py:1577` (`persona stats`).
- **Git:** committed; `charter/hooks.py:8189` (`_commit_dispatch`) commits/pushes it
  reactively **only** when `[memory] share` is `commit`/`push` (default `local` → left
  uncommitted for the operator).
- **Encoding details:**
  - Path: `personas/_dispatch/{when:%Y-%m}.<device>.jsonl`, `when` UTC now
    (`charter/dispatch.py:56`). The Python charter named the second part `{host}`
    (`:60`-`:62`); in purlis it is a device id, not a hostname (FD-25, below).
  - `<device>` is the device's name for its logs, as the landing log names its file (FD-25:
    the device id from the machine store, never minted by a hook). Only before an id is
    minted, or where the store keeps none, is it Python's `host`: `socket.gethostname()`
    first label, `[^A-Za-z0-9_-]` stripped, 32 chars, `"unknown"` when empty
    (`charter/dispatch.py:50`-`:53`). No env override. Month files an earlier version named
    by a hostname are read beside the new ones; FR-9 renames them (#607).
  - One line = `json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True) + "\n"` → **keys are alphabetical**, ASCII
    escaped, no spaces beyond `json.dumps` defaults (`", "`/`": "`).
  - Written with `os.open(..., O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0o644)` and one `os.write` — no
    lock; `record_handoff` additionally passes `O_NOFOLLOW` (`charter/dispatch.py:198`).
  - `ts` = `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(timespec="seconds")` →
    `2026-09-17T14:01:20+00:00`. A row with no timezone is read as UTC
    (`charter/dispatch.py:338`).
  - A row is kept by the reader only if it is a dict with `agent` or `event`
    (`charter/dispatch.py:316`); unparseable lines are skipped silently.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | ISO-8601 UTC, seconds | always | When | stable | `charter/dispatch.py:77` |
| `agent` | string | on dispatch + resume rows | `subagent_type` — a persona name or a generic (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `claude`, `Plan`) | stable | `charter/dispatch.py:77`, `:43` |
| `event` | `advice` \| `resume` \| `handoff` | absent on a plain dispatch (that absence *is* what `tally` counts) | Row kind | stable | `charter/dispatch.py:95`, `:131`, `:167`, `:351` |
| `placement` | `here` \| `elsewhere` | handoff rows only | Was the new chat in this workspace | stable | `charter/dispatch.py:190`, `charter/commands_handoff.py:261` |
| `created` | bool | handoff rows only | Whether the handoff created the workspace | stable | `charter/dispatch.py:189` |

Nothing else may appear: no prompt, description, workspace name or persona name on a
handoff row (`charter/dispatch.py:170` docstring).

### `personas/_dispatch/<YYYY-MM>.<host>.backfill.jsonl`

- **Format:** JSON Lines, **rewritten whole** (not appended).
- **Status:** stable — committed, read by the same tally readers as the live file.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/dispatch.py:476` (`backfill`), from
  `purlis persona dispatch-backfill` (`charter/commands_persona.py:1714`, which then
  commits the files at `:1734`-`:1736`).
- **Read by:** the same `_read_all` glob (`charter/dispatch.py:327`); excluded from
  `_live_keys` (`:417`) so it never de-duplicates against itself.
- **Git:** committed.
- **Encoding details:** every existing `*.backfill.jsonl` is unlinked, then each month file
  is written as the **sorted set** of its `json.dumps({"ts","agent"}, sort_keys=True)` lines
  joined by `\n` plus a trailing `\n` (`charter/dispatch.py:500`-`:503`). Rows carry only
  `ts` and `agent`. Source: this project's Claude Code transcripts under
  `~/.claude/projects/<plane path with "/"→"-">` (`charter/dispatch.py:383`-`:394`,
  `:443`); `ts` is the transcript timestamp truncated to 19 chars (`:472`), so backfilled
  rows have **no timezone suffix** and are read as UTC. `last_backfill()` uses the file
  mtime (`:430`).

---

### `personas/_skills/<YYYY-MM>.<device>.jsonl`

- **Format:** JSON Lines, append-only.
- **Status:** stable — committed, written by a hook, read by `persona stats`.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/skilluse.py:67` (`record`) from `charter/hooks.py:8054`
  (PostToolUse on the `Skill` tool; reads `tool_input.skill` or opencode's `name`).
- **Read by:** `charter/skilluse.py:95` (`_read_all`) → `by_persona` (`:121`), `drift`
  (`:133`); `charter/commands_persona.py:1622` (`persona stats` SKILLS block).
- **Git:** committed. Nothing commits it automatically (no `_commit_dispatch` equivalent).
- **Encoding details:** path `personas/_skills/{%Y-%m}.{device}.jsonl`
  (`charter/skilluse.py:59`, `:62`-`:64`), `<device>` named as the dispatch log's is (FD-25;
  Python's host derivation, `:48`-`:51`, only before a device id is minted); same
  `json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)` + `\n`, same `O_APPEND`, `0o644` (`:80`-`:85`). Rows
  without a truthy `skill` are ignored on read (`:116`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | ISO-8601 UTC, seconds | always | When | stable | `charter/skilluse.py:80` |
| `skill` | string | always (row dropped if empty) | Skill name as the harness reported it; may be `plugin:skill`, compared on the leaf | stable | `charter/skilluse.py:82`, `:128` |
| `persona` | string or **`null`** | always present; `null` when no persona is active | Which persona invoked it | stable | `charter/skilluse.py:82` |

### `.claude/agents/<name>.md` (generated sub-agent)

> **Retired in purlis (#1451, spec #1434 decision 2).** A persona is a role a chat runs as
> for its whole life and is never a harness sub-agent, so purlis no longer writes, refreshes,
> lints or reads this file, and `purlis persona sync-agents` answers with one sentence saying
> what replaced it. A file under `.claude/agents/` that purlis did not generate is still
> somebody's own sub-agent, mirrored into workspaces as before.
>
> **The migration** is `purlis doctor --fix persona-agents`, applied only by name. It removes
> each file here that purlis generated **and that git can give back** (tracked, with no
> uncommitted change) and no other, and says every file it removed and every file it left
> alone. Authorship is the marker **where the generator wrote it**: the
> file opens with a frontmatter, the first line under it is the marker comment described
> below (under either spelling), a blank line follows, and the next line opens `This
> sub-agent acts as the **<name>** persona — ` with the file's own name. A file with no
> marker is hand-written. A file that carries the marker in any other shape was edited by
> hand, copied to another name, or only quotes it, and is left alone. A link is never
> followed or removed. The generator left no hash, and what it rendered depended on the
> machine, so a generated file whose charter text was edited cannot be told from a stale
> one: the marker line says not to edit the file, and every sync overwrote such an edit.
> The same fix rewrites `model:` and two `color:` values in `persona.md` (the key table
> above), reports the retired keys, and removes the in-flight records and the agent map this
> machine kept for the sub-agents (in the state directory, below). It makes no commit, and a
> second run changes nothing.
>
> A sub-agent call whose type is a persona's name is refused by `pretooluse-dispatch`, with
> the route: `purlis dispatch --to <persona>`. What follows is the format as the generator
> wrote it, kept because the fix's authorship check rests on it.

- **Format:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter (the harness's format).
- **Status:** stable — committed, read by Claude Code itself, and regenerated byte-for-byte
  by `lint`'s staleness check (`charter/commands_persona.py:1437` compares
  `path.read_text().strip()` with a fresh render — so a Rust writer must match exactly or
  every persona lints stale).
- **Tier:** Plane, rebuildable — committed, and regenerated byte for byte from the persona.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands_persona.py:1164` (`_write_agent`), from
  `purlis persona sync-agents` (`:2035`/`:2066`), `persona create` (`:129`) and
  `persona migrate` (`:1854`); in purlis, also a project template for each persona it
  makes (FR-17). Removed by `_remove_agent` (`:1168`) for a draft, an
  unreadable frontmatter key, a removed persona, or an orphan sweep (`:2101`-`:2106`).
- **Read by:** Claude Code (sub-agent definition); `charter/commands_persona.py:1434`
  (staleness), `charter/freshness.py:24` (restart hint),
  `charter/workspace.py:2081`/`:4127` (mirrored into a workspace's checkouts).
- **Git:** committed (`.gitignore` covers only `.claude/settings.local.json` —
  `charter/commands.py:1100`; `git ls-files` on the live plane lists all five agents).
- **Encoding details:**
  - Whole file = `"---\n" + "\n".join(fm) + "\n---\n" + body` (`charter/commands_persona.py:1117`);
    `body` starts with the marker comment and ends with a trailing newline.
  - Frontmatter lines, in this fixed order (`charter/commands_persona.py:870`-`:955`):
    1. `name: <name>`
    2. `description: "<escaped>"` — `_yaml_str` (`:773`): newlines → spaces, strip, then
       `\` → `\\` and `"` → `\"`, wrapped in double quotes.
    3. `tools: <agent-tools>[, mcp__<server>__*…]` — only when `agent-tools` is set; MCP
       grants appended for each declared server whose name passes `mcp_name_ok` and is not
       already mentioned (`:879`-`:892`).
    4. `skills: a, b` — when `skills:` is declared (`:908`-`:910`).
    5. `isolation: worktree` — when `dispatch-isolation: worktree` (`:916`-`:917`).
    6. `disallowedTools: <verbatim>` — when `disallowed-tools` is set (`:923`-`:924`).
    7. `mcpServers:` followed by `  - {"<server>": {…}}` per server, **sorted by server
       name**, each a one-line JSON object of the whole single-key mapping via
       `contain.json_line` (`:926`-`:952`).
    8. passthrough keys in declaration order `model`, `color`, `memory` (`:953`-`:955`,
       `charter/persona.py:305`).
  - Marker (the file's identity as generated):
    `<!-- GENERATED by \`charter persona sync-agents\` from <plane-relative persona.md> — edit the persona, not this file. -->`
    (`charter/commands_persona.py:766`, `:1105`). A file without the marker is never
    overwritten or deleted (`:1159`, `:1171`).
  - Body sections, in order (`charter/commands_persona.py:1105`-`:1116`): intro line naming
    the persona and role → the **resolved** purlis (inheritance concatenated) → `## As a
    persona sub-agent` with the forge credential rule (`_credential_rule`, `:811` — derived
    from the plane's declared forges, so `gh` vs `glab` varies per plane), the credential
    block (`:1077` or the `vault: none` variant at `:1085`), the `bin/` block, the
    `uses:`/`borrows:` block (wording differs by whether `borrows:` is declared, `:1020`
    vs `:1029`), the `memory:` note (only when `memory:` is set), the generic handoff line,
    the conventions line → `## Memory`.
  - Description when neither `agent-description` nor `description` is set
    (`charter/commands_persona.py:778`-`:808`): `The {role} persona. Delegate to it for
    {delegate-when}.` (or `Delegate {role.lower()} tasks to it.`) plus one of
    ` Runs {tools} and pulls credentials from the '{vault}' vault.` /
    ` Runs {tools}. Holds no credentials of its own.` /
    ` Pulls credentials from the '{vault}' vault.` / ` Holds no credentials of its own.`,
    plus a worktree sentence when `dispatch-isolation: worktree`.
  - Written with plain `write_text` into `<tree>/.claude/agents/`; `sync-agents` run from a
    linked worktree writes into that worktree (`charter/commands_persona.py:2048`-`:2063`).

### `.charter/persona-state/ephemeral/<session>/<name|_shared>/<slug>.md`

- **Format:** the memory-file shape above, `kind` = `ephemeral`.
- **Status:** internal — one module writes and reads it as session scratch, it is
  gitignored, and it is deleted by the GC. Deleting it loses that session's scratch notes
  only; nothing regenerates them, and no other process depends on them.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — one session's scratch.
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:2298` (`remember(..., ephemeral=True)` →
  `memstore.write(..., index=False)` at `:2320`), from
  `purlis persona remember --ephemeral`.
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:2330` (`memories(..., ephemeral=True)`),
  `charter/recall.py:122` (the opt-in `ephemeral` scope),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:1271` (`persona recall`), `charter/statusline.py:1779`.
- **Git:** gitignored — it is under `/.charter/`, ignored by `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE`
  (`charter/commands.py:1095`).
- **Encoding details:** `<session>` is `session.bucket()` — `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID`, else
  `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, else the literal `nosession`
  (`charter/session.py:65`-`:66`, `:23`, `charter/persona.py:205`-`:215`). No `MEMORY.md` is
  written here (`index=False`). Directories are created 0700 via `config.mkdir_for`
  (`charter/memstore.py:83`), files 0600 via `config.open_for`. GC: a session directory that
  is not the current one and whose newest mtime is older than 6h is `rmtree`d
  (`charter/persona.py:2462`-`:2490`), from `purlis persona _gc`
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1917`) on SessionStart.
- **Collected (purlis):** when the app opens the plane, a session's folder is removed whole once
  it, each persona folder in it and each file in those was last written 30 days or more before,
  unless the session is one the reopen record brings back. A folder holding anything but
  `<persona>/<file>` is kept whole (`retention::on_open`, #1004).

---

### `.charter/persona-state/trace/<session>.jsonl`

- **Format:** JSON Lines, append-only.
- **Status:** stable (by the brief's rule) — written by hooks and CLI commands in one
  process and read by `purlis trace` / `purlis persona recall` in another. Machine-local
  and safe to delete (the history is lost; nothing regenerates it), so it is a borderline
  call — see the Appendix.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — per-session history nothing regenerates and nothing but `persona stats` reads.
- **Written by:** `charter/trace.py:69` (`record`) — persona-relevant events:
  `persona-use` (`charter/persona.py:1533`), `memory` (`charter/persona.py:2323`), `note`
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1821`), `dispatch`/`resume`/`skill` (`charter/hooks.py`),
  plus guard/secret events owned by other areas.
- **Read by:** `charter/trace.py:93` (`read`), `:106` (`for_persona`),
  `charter/commands_persona.py:1280`, `:1824`, `charter/commands_persona.py:1868`
  (`purlis trace`).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Encoding details:** one `contain.json_line(rec) + "\n"` per event, appended through
  `config.open_for` (0600 under the state dir). Every record carries
  `ts` = **local naive** `datetime.now().isoformat(timespec="seconds")` and `event`; other
  fields are the call's kwargs with `None` dropped, in insertion order (**not** sorted —
  unlike the `_dispatch` store). `<session>` is `session.bucket()`.
- **Collected (purlis):** when the app opens the plane, a trace last appended to 30 days
  or more before is removed, unless a chat the plane's reopen record will bring back is its
  session, or it records a secret handed out (kept until AU-5 audits those events, V71;
  `retention::on_open`). `nosession.jsonl` follows the same rule.

---

### `.charter/reports/<id>.json`

- **Format:** JSON object, `indent=2`, no trailing newline.
- **Status:** stable — written by `cli.main`'s crash handler in one process and read by
  every later `purlis report …` invocation; the Reporter reads and edits the drafts.
  (Document the **shape only** — contents may quote a Reporter's own prose.)
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy — the Python charter's report drafts; the Rust `purlis report` keeps none (ADR 0059).
- **Written by:** `charter/report.py:302` (`_write`, via `config.write_for` into a 0700
  dir), from `record_bug` (`:374`) / `record_described` (`:384`) / `mark_sent` (`:630`);
  crash path `charter/cli.py:2028`.
- **Read by:** `charter/report.py:268` (`load`), `:281` (`_all` → `pending`,
  `all_reports`), `charter/commands_report.py`.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Encoding details:** filename `<id>.json` where `id` is the 16-hex fingerprint —
  for a bug, `sha256(exception_type + "\n" + deepest purlis frame)[:16]`
  (`charter/report.py:91`-`:110`); for a described report,
  `sha256(kind + "\n" + scrubbed text)[:16]` (`:397`). Same id twice = the same file, with
  `occurrences` incremented (`:351`). Caps: 25 distinct pending reports
  (`charter/report.py:38`, `:359`), unsent drafts older than 30 days pruned on write
  (`:43`, `:325`).
- **Collected (purlis):** nothing here writes these any more, so when the app opens the
  plane it removes every `<16 lowercase hex>.json` last written 30 days or more before, sent or
  not (`retention::on_open`).

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | 16 hex chars | always | Fingerprint = filename stem | stable | `charter/report.py:364` |

Persona relevance of the scrub: `charter/report.py:164`-`:175` redacts every persona name
(`persona.list_personas()`) and every workspace/vault identifier out of a described report
before it is stored.

### `.charter/handbacks/` — reports back from handed-off chats

- **Format:** one JSON object per file, compact, no trailing newline.
- **Status:** **internal** — written by the app, taken by the `purlis` binary's own hooks.
  A report waits here from the moment a dispatched task sends it (`purlis dispatch report`,
  #1436), or a handed-off chat sends the one its stop asks for, by the same command, until the
  turn it is handed to. `purlis handoff report` sends nothing since #1471: it refuses, naming
  `purlis dispatch report`. A file an older purlis left here is read as before.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — a report waiting to be taken by one chat's hook. **Not
  readable or writable by a sandboxed chat of a harness whose hooks run outside its sandbox**
  (Claude Code today; ADR 0067 class 2 as amended, D-T59-19): the app leaves these files and
  purlis's hooks take them. **On Codex and opencode a chat can still read and write this
  folder**: the wrap holds the whole harness, hooks included, and the hooks are what deliver,
  so it is not denied there until delivery moves onto the hook socket (#1457); the checks each
  file gets as it is read are what stand. `purlis workspace rename` run inside a chat that is
  denied the folder leaves `workspace-<old>/` where it is and says so; the app moves it to `workspace-<new>/` when the project is next opened, from the rename's
  journal (`wscmd::rename::kept_reports_follow`).
- **Written by:** `purlis_core::handback::leave` (purlis#259), from the app's answer to a
  report, from `handback::orphan` when a chat with reports waiting is closed, from
  `handback::moved` when a chat with reports waiting is started again under a new number,
  which moves `chat-<old>/` to `chat-<new>/`, and from the app when the person stops a chat
  another chat started (#1448): the chat that asked is left purlis's own word that the
  operator stopped it (`stopped`, below). A message between an asking chat and a task it
  dispatched (#1442) is written by `purlis_core::dispatchtalk::leave`, from the app's answer to
  `purlis dispatch tell`, `note`, `ask` and `answer`, and moved by `dispatchtalk::moved` on the
  same restart (`said-<old>/` to `said-<new>/`). Only the app writes either.
- **Read by:** `charter hook userpromptsubmit` (`chat-<n>/`, `<n>` from `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID`)
  and `charter hook sessionstart` (`workspace-<ws>/`, the session's workspace, or `plane-root/`
  for a session at the plane root), through
  `handback::take`, which **removes each file it reads**: a report reaches one turn. The same
  `userpromptsubmit` hook takes `said-<n>/` through `dispatchtalk::take`, which removes each
  file it reads too. **Removed by:** the reader; `handback::took`, for a report the waiting
  `purlis dispatch wait` printed itself (#1441); and `dispatchtalk::forget`, which empties
  `said-<n>/` when chat `<n>` is closed, because a message is for that one chat's turn.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Layout:** `chat-<n>/` for a report to a chat the app has open, `workspace-<ws>/` for one
  whose chat has closed, and `plane-root/` for one whose chat worked at the plane root and has
  closed (SI-1b). Each file is `<nanoseconds since the epoch, 24 digits>-<uuid>.json`,
  so a directory reads in arrival order; it is written as `.<name>` and renamed into place, and a
  reader skips a name starting with `.`. An empty directory is removed by the reader.
  `said-<n>/` holds the messages waiting for chat `<n>` (#1442), in files named the same way.
  **`said-<n>` is never reached through a link**: where it, or a directory above it down from
  `.charter/`, is a symbolic link or is not a directory, nothing is read from it, written to
  it or removed from it.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `from` | str | the chat that reported, by the name it is shown under |
| `from_workspace` | str | the workspace that chat works in, or `plane root` |
| `to` | str | the chat that asked, by the name it is shown under |
| `to_workspace` | str | the workspace that chat handed off from — where the report goes when it is gone — or `plane root` for a chat that handed off from the plane root (SI-1b). Two words with a space, which no workspace name can be, so a reader that holds the field to the name rule drops the report rather than joining the words onto `workspaces/` |
| `summary` | str | the report: trimmed, at most 4,096 bytes, no control character but `\n` and no invisible one. Empty in a file that carries `stopped`, and only there |
| `stopped` | object, absent | **purlis's own word that the operator stopped the chat `from` names** (#1443, #1448): `{"wrote": <bool>, "task": true, "by_person": true, "record": "<str>", "below": ["<str>"], "limit": {"kind": "time", "limit": <n>, "worked": <n>} \| {"kind": "above", "limit": <n>}}`. **`limit`** (#1512) is set where purlis, not the person, stopped the task, at the working time the person set for a task (`worked` minutes against `limit`), or with the task above it that reached its time limit (`above`). The word then says "stopped at its time limit" or "stopped with the task above it, at that task's time limit", with the figure and where the limit is changed, and the fixed sentence "purlis ended this task at a limit the person set. Do not dispatch it again to carry on unless the person asks." in place of the person's; absent for every other stop. `wrote` says whether that chat sent a last report before it ended. **For a task it says which of the person's two ways ended it** (#1488): `wrote: true` is *stopped by the person*, and the file then carries that task's one short report in `summary` and `task`, quoted as data under purlis's own heading; `wrote: false` is *closed by the person*, with an empty `summary` and no `task`. Both add one fixed sentence, "The person ended this task. Do not dispatch it again unless they ask." `below` names the tasks ended with it, below it, at most 32, each held to a task name's rule; absent where there were none. **A task cannot produce this word through the report channel**: a report line has no field for it, and the app writes it only on the window's own commands. What it is not proof against is the folder itself: anything running as the person outside a sandbox can write a file here, and such a file is read as purlis's word (#1457). `task` is `true` where the stopped chat was dispatched as a task, and absent for one a handoff opened: the sentence says "the task you dispatched to it" or "the work you handed to it" by it. `by_person` is `true` where the person started the stopped chat as a task from the asking chat's tab (#1438), and absent otherwise: wording only. `record` is the project-relative path of the session record the app wrote for the stopped chat, from the app's own note and never a path a chat named; absent when it wrote none. Written only by the app, and the one way it says a chat was stopped: when the person stops a chat or the chats below one, answers *Stop them* as they close the chat that asked, or closes the tab of a task that had not reported. No report a chat sends has a way to carry it. Absent in every report, and in every file written before it. But for a task's stop that carries its report, a file that carries it holds an empty `summary` and no `task`, and is drawn as one fixed sentence of purlis's, outside any quote. Held on the way in: a `stopped` beside a `summary` that is not empty or beside a `task` in any shape but that one (`task` and `wrote` both true, a `summary` a report may carry, and a `task` part that is a chat's own: not `unreported`, not `cancelled`), or a `below` that is too long or holds a name a task may not have, or with a `record` that is absolute, climbs with `..`, holds a backtick or an undrawable character, drops the file. So does a `from` that holds one of `⟨ ⟩ ·` or a backtick: the name is drawn inside purlis's own sentence, and the app writes it with those marks replaced (`(`, `)`, `-`, `'`) |
| `task` | object, absent | what a task's report says besides (#1436): `{"outcome": "done" \| "blocked" \| "failed" \| "cancelled", "changed": "<str>", "record": "<str>", "by_person": true, "unreported": true, "stepped_in": true}`. `cancelled` (#1441) is written by the app for a task its asking chat cancelled, whatever that task's chat said, and for no other. `stepped_in` (#1442) is `true` when the person typed in the task's chat while it worked, from the app's own note of their keys and never anything the chat said; absent otherwise, and nothing they typed is written anywhere. Absent for a handoff's report, and in every file written before tasks. `outcome` is how the persona chat says the task ended, or `cancelled`. `changed` is what it says changed, in its own words, held to `summary`'s rule; absent when it said nothing. `record` is the project-relative path of the session record the app wrote for that chat, from the app's own note of what it wrote and never a path the chat named; absent when it wrote none. Held on the way in: an `outcome` that is none of the four, a `changed` that breaks the rule, or a `record` that is absolute, climbs with `..`, holds a backtick or an undrawable character, drops the whole report. `by_person` is `true` in the report of a task the person started from the asking chat's tab (#1438), copied from the app's record of the persona chat (`chats[].from.by`), and absent otherwise: the report then reads "a task the person started from this chat's tab". Wording only, as `by` is. `unreported` is `true` in a report the app wrote in the persona chat's place (#1443), and absent otherwise: no chat said any of it. `outcome` is then `"failed"`, `changed` is absent, and `summary` is exactly `ended without a report`: that chat's program ended on its own before it reported. A chat the person stopped or closed is not written this way: that is `stopped`, above, and a `task` has no key for it. **Held on the way in**: a file with `unreported` in any other shape drops the whole report, so nothing that can write this directory has a sentence of its own read as purlis's |

**Held again on the way in.** A file whose `summary` breaks the report rule, whose names break
the chat-name rule, whose workspaces are neither a workspace's name nor `plane root`, or which
is not JSON at all, is removed and
handed to nobody. What is handed over is quoted as data: every line of the summary behind `> `.
A file that carries `stopped` has nothing to quote: it is said as purlis's sentence, which no
chat's words are part of.

**A message in `said-<n>/`** (#1442) is one JSON object:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | str | `follow_up` (the asking chat, to a task still working), `note` or `question` (a task, to the chat that asked), or `answer` (the asking chat, to that question) |
| `from` | str | the chat that sent it, by the name it is shown under, as the app wrote it |
| `chat` | int | the app's number for that chat: what `purlis dispatch answer <chat>` names for a question |
| `text` | str | the message: held to `summary`'s rule |

It is held again on the way in: a `kind` that is none of the four, a `from` that breaks the
chat-name rule or holds a backtick or an asterisk (either would break out of how the name is
quoted above the message), or a `text` that breaks the report rule, drops the file. What is
handed over is quoted as data, under a sentence that says which chat's words follow.

**No file here says the person said something** (#1496). The person may answer, in the purlis
window, a question a task put to its asking chat. That answer, and the word to the asking chat
that the person answered, are kept in the app's memory and handed to each chat by the app
itself, on the hook channel (to the task's waiting `purlis dispatch ask`, or to the chat's
`userpromptsubmit` hook when it asks): they are written to no file in `said-<n>/`. A message
file has no field for the person's mark. One that carries such a field is read without it,
as the chat's message its `kind` and `from` make it, under the sentence that says it is not
the person's word; and one whose `kind` claims it is dropped. So is one whose `from` reads
like the app's own words for who spoke (the person, "you", purlis, and look-alike spellings:
`dispatchtalk::reads_as_a_mark`): the app writes a chat that really has such a name as
`chat '<name>'`, so a file that says it is from "The person" is not one the app left. So a file a chat manages to
write into this folder cannot make its own text arrive as the person's.

### `~/.config/charter/reporting-consent` (outside the plane)

- **Format:** plain text, one sentence.
- **Status:** stable — it is the consent record `purlis report send` gates on, written by
  one command and read by another, and the Reporter deletes it to withdraw.
- **Tier:** Machine, syncable, legacy — the Python `purlis report`'s consent; the Rust one keeps none (ADR 0059).
- **Written by:** `charter/report.py:472` (`grant_consent`) from
  `charter/commands_report.py:104`.
- **Read by:** `charter/report.py:468` (`has_consent`) — existence only; contents are never
  parsed.
- **Git:** outside the plane. Path is
  `$CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME` → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` → `~/.config`, then `charter/reporting-consent`
  (`charter/report.py:462`-`:465`) — deliberately per-human, not per-plane and not committed.
- **Encoding details:** exact body at `charter/report.py:475`-`:477`; parent created with a
  plain `mkdir(parents=True)`, written with `write_text` (umask decides the mode).

---

### `.charter/sessions/<sid>.persona`, `.charter/terminals/<tid>.persona`, `.charter/active-persona`

- **Format:** plain text — the persona name plus `\n`.
- **Status:** stable — written by `purlis persona use` in one process and read by every
  other purlis process in that session/terminal (status line, hooks, tool gate, frame).
  (The `sessions/`/`terminals/` directories themselves belong to the workspaces area; the
  `.persona` files in them are `persona.py`'s.)
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — per-session and per-pane pointers; `active-persona` is Clone state (see its own entry).
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:1488` (`set_active`, `config.write_for` at `:1528` →
  0600 under a 0700 dir); the plane-wide file only when there is neither a session id nor a
  terminal id (`:1529`-`:1530`). Removed by `clear_active` (`:1541`).
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:1199` (`_read_pointer`) → `_resolved` (`:1379`) →
  `resolve_active`/`selection`, `for_session` (`:1225`), `pointers_naming` (`:1208`).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Encoding details:** content is `name + "\n"`; readers `.strip()` and treat empty as
  unset. Resolution order (`charter/persona.py:1379`-`:1410`): `--persona` →
  `$CHARTER_PERSONA` (stripped; whitespace-only = unset, `:1242`) → session pointer →
  terminal pointer → `.charter/active-persona` → `charter.toml` `[persona] default` →
  `personas/.default` → none. A rung naming a persona that does not exist still wins
  (`charter/persona.py:1438`). Session id = `session.bucket()`; terminal id =
  `session.terminal()` (`$TERM_SESSION_ID`/`$TMUX_PANE`/`$STY`/`$SSH_TTY`), and a `%9` pane
  becomes the filename `-9.persona` (observed in the fixture run).

---

### `.charter/mcp-approved.json`

- **Format:** JSON object, `indent=2`, `ensure_ascii=False`, trailing newline.
- **Status:** stable — machine-local by design (an approval must not travel in git). **In
  purlis it is written by `purlis persona approve-mcp`** (#1451), which is refused inside a
  chat, and read when a chat that runs as the persona is started (`mcp.json` above). It was
  written by `sync-agents --approve-mcp`, which is retired; an approval recorded then
  carries, because the fingerprint is of the entry and the vault and neither changed.
- **Tier:** Clone state — an operator's consent record.
- **Written by:** `charter/mcpseen.py:253` (`approve`, replaces the persona's whole set),
  from `charter/commands_persona.py:2029`.
- **Read by:** `charter/mcpseen.py:247` (`approved`) → `charter/persona.py:779`
  (`mcp_render_entry`) and `mcp_withheld` (`:832`).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Sandbox:** **a sandboxed chat never writes it** (ADR 0067 §5, the integrity class, #1458),
  under either name of the state folder and where `$PURLIS_HOME` puts it. A chat may read it.
  A write that fails is never said to be recorded: `approve-mcp` exits 1 and says nothing was
  approved, and inside a sandboxed chat that it is the person's to give.
- **Encoding details:** `{"<persona>": ["<64-hex sha256>", …]}`, values sorted
  (`charter/mcpseen.py:262`, digest at `charter/mcpseen.py:236`). The fingerprint is a SHA-256 of the **consent line** the
  operator was shown. (This file sits on the boundary with the secrets area; included here
  because `persona.py` is its only consumer.)

---

### `[memory] share` — how it affects persona files

`charter.toml`'s `[memory] share` (`local` | `commit` | `push`, default `local`,
`charter/instance.py:460`, clamped at `charter/instance.py:444`) decides only whether purlis *itself* commits
and pushes the files above — never their format:

- `purlis persona remember` (persistent): commits the memory file **and** its `MEMORY.md`
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1206`-`:1209` → `charter/planegit.py:98`).
- `purlis persona forget`: commits the memory **directory**
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1308`-`:1310`).
- `purlis persona optimize --apply`: commits the memory directory
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1786`-`:1787`).
- `purlis persona dispatch-backfill`: commits every `_dispatch/*.jsonl`
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1734`-`:1736`).
- The dispatch hook: commits the one tally file it appended, under an flock
  (`charter/hooks.py:8189`-`:8216`).
- `purlis persona memory-sync`: commits every uncommitted path matching
  `personas/[^/]+/(?:memory|refs)/` regardless of posture, after a secret scan
  (`charter/commands_persona.py:1316`, `:1345`-`:1400`).

Under `local` (the default) purlis writes the files and commits nothing; `personas/`
therefore shows up in `git status` for a human.

**In purlis** no command commits a memory on its own. `share` is read only as the
deprecated alias of `[plane].mode`, and the whole plane is saved by one save function, by
hand or by auto-save (ADR 0051).

---

## Vaults: the registry, and nothing inside it

This section and the one after it cover two areas that meet: the vault registry — its shape,
never its contents — and every file purlis writes for a harness to read, inside the plane
and outside it. Both use two conventions:

- **plane root** = `config.ROOT`; **state dir** = `config.STATE_DIR` = `<plane>/.charter/`
  unless `$CHARTER_HOME` is set, in which case it is that path verbatim
  (`charter/config.py:791`, `charter/config.py:99`).
- "**IF ABSENT**" = purlis writes only the key(s) it owns, only when they are not already
  there, and never repairs or reformats a file it cannot parse.

No real vault content was read for this section. Shapes come from the writers in
`charter/secrets/*` plus a throwaway plane generated for the survey, whose only value is the
literal `fixture-not-a-secret`.

### `vaults.json` (plane root — the SHARED half)

- **Format:** JSON object.
- **Status:** **stable** — committed to the plane's git, hand-editable, read by every
  purlis process (doctor, statusline, hooks) and written by `purlis vault add --share`.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed, and it holds no values.
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/registry.py:215` (`save_shared`) → `_write`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:173`), from `add_vault`/`remove_vault`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:304`, `charter/secrets/registry.py:347`). Commands:
  `purlis vault add <name> … --share`, `purlis vault remove <name>`.
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/registry.py:65` (`load_shared`) → `load_registry`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:95`); `charter/secrets/registry.py:134`
  (`shared_files_outside_plane`, doctor); `charter/secrets/registry.py:119`
  (`malformed_shared`).
- **Path:** `charter/config.py:774` (`SHARED_VAULTS = root / "vaults.json"`).
- **Git:** committed (nothing in `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE`, `charter/commands.py:1087`,
  ignores it — only `/.charter/` is ignored).
- **Encoding:** `json.dump(doc, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)` + one trailing `"\n"`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:197`-`198`). Key order = **insertion order**, never
  sorted. Mode **0644**, set on the descriptor with `fchmod` before the truncate
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:188`-`193`, `charter/secrets/registry.py:215`). Not atomic
  (no tmp+rename), no locking. Parent created with `config.private_mkdir`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:187`). **purlis diverges (#434):** both halves are
  replaced whole through `rewrite::replace` (a temp file beside, fsync, rename), and a half
  that is a symlink is refused rather than written through. This half is a committed file, so
  it keeps the mode it has; a new one gets the umask's (0644 under the usual `022`) rather
  than a forced 0644.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `vaults` | object | defaulted to `{}` on read | name → entry | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:60` |
| `vaults.<name>` | object | — | one vault. A non-object entry is dropped from the merged view and reported | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:92` |
| `vaults.<name>.provider` | string | required | `keyring` \| `plain-file` \| `reference` \| `1password`. `keyring` is purlis's (ADR 0047), the default `vault add` writes; a Python charter reads it as an unknown provider | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:39`, `:245`; `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/registry.rs` (`PROVIDERS`) |
| `vaults.<name>.persona` | string \| null | written always, `null` when no `--persona` | persona tag | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:299` |
| `vaults.<name>.config` | object | written always (may be `{}`) | provider config, merged per key over the local half | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:113` |

`config` keys (all providers share the namespace):

| Key | Type | Written when | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `file` | string | `plain-file` and `reference` always; other providers only with `--file` | vault file; **relative to the plane root when inside it, else absolute** | stable | `charter/commands_secrets.py:141`, `:147`, `:149`; `charter/commands_secrets.py:34` (`_portable_file`); resolved by `charter/secrets/base.py:40` |
| `op-vault` | string | `--provider 1password` (required) | 1Password vault name | stable | `charter/commands_secrets.py:177`, read `charter/secrets/onepassword.py:134` |
| `op-item` | string | `--op-item` only | item title; default `charter-<vault>` | stable | `charter/commands_secrets.py:179`, read `charter/secrets/onepassword.py:149` |
| `account` | string | `--account` | 1Password account pin — **LOCAL_ONLY, never written to the shared half**. Held to a sign-in address's alphabet (a letter or digit, then letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`) by `vault add` and the guided set-up alike; a pasted `https://…/` is stored as its address | stable | `charter/secrets/registry.py:50`, `:298`, `:317` |
| `env` | object `{TARGET: SOURCE}` | `--env TARGET=SOURCE` / `--token-env X` | env var NAMES only (e.g. `{"OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "OP_ACME_TOKEN"}`); never a value | stable | `charter/commands_secrets.py:188`, `charter/commands_secrets.py:80`; read `charter/secrets/base.py:291` |
| `token` | string, `"keyring"` | *New vault* in the app with a service-account token, *Change how this vault signs in*, `vault add --token-stdin` (#1527) | **Declares that the vault is read with a service-account token purlis keeps in the system keyring, through no variable.** It names no secret, no variable and no keyring item, so it travels with `--share`. It reads as the binding `{"OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "service-account-token"}`, where `service-account-token` is a fixed word that is no variable's name and is never looked up in an environment; an `env` binding of `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` beside it is not honoured. The item is found only through the `identity` record in the local half, whose `bindings` and `ids` use that word as their source (the keyring item's account too). A vault that declares it on a machine with no record is refused as having no token there. Any other value is refused, never read as "no token". 1Password vaults only; a Python charter ignores the key | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/identity.rs` (`TOKEN`, `KEPT_SOURCE`, `bindings`, `token_refusal`), `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/setup.rs` |
| `version` | string | hand-written only | `browser://` resolver's npx package version | stable | `charter/secrets/reference.py:104` |
| `identity` | object | the vault tab's token box / *Move…*, the guided set-up and `vault add --token-stdin` (in the same write as the vault's registration), into the **local half only** | The moved-token record: `{"held":"keyring","base":"purlis","bindings":{TARGET:SOURCE},"op_vault":…,"op_item":…,"account":…,"op_cmd":…,"op_team":…,"ids":{SOURCE:<id>}}`. `op_item` is the item the vault keeps its secrets in, pinned by every record made since #1527. A record made before has none. When this machine chose the item the vault reads (its half's own `op-item`, or the default), the next read through the record writes that item into it, best effort, and from then on it is held to it like any other; when the committed half chose it, the record is not honoured and never pinned, and a read is refused until the token is given again from the vault's tab (#1542, ADR 0047's amendment of that date). Each source is read from the keyring item `<base>/@identity/<id>` (account the source name) first and the environment second. **`base` says which base, and only that one is read:** a move made now writes `"base":"purlis"` and its item under `purlis/@identity/<id>`; a record without the field was made before the rename and is read only from `charter/@identity/<id>` during the rename window (#1261). `rename-local`'s keychain copy switches a record to `purlis` only after every item of it read back the same from `purlis/@identity/<id>`, and `purlis migrate --undo` removes the field again (RN-6); a `base` charter does not know is an error. A read happens **only while the vault's effective `env` (with `token`)/op-vault/op-item/account still equal `bindings`/`op_vault`/`op_item`/`account`** and the pinned `op_cmd`/`op_team` verify. **Read from `.charter/vaults.json` alone**; a committed one is ignored, so a commit cannot mark or redirect (#271 review, U2/U5). charter-app only (#237, ADR 0047 as amended); a Python charter ignores the key | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/identity.rs` (`MARK`, `BASE`, `READ_BASES`, `record`, `record_matches`, `pinned_op`) |

Legacy spellings `op_vault` / `op_item` are still read (`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:134`,
`:149`) and never written.

### `.charter/vaults.json` (the LOCAL half)

- **Format:** JSON object, same schema as above.
- **Status:** **stable** — hand-editable, and read by other processes (statusline counts it
  directly: `charter/statusline.py:799`; doctor; every `purlis secret` call).
- **Tier:** Clone state — the vault registry V2 names.
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/registry.py:209` (`save_registry`), from `add_vault`
  without `--share` (`charter/secrets/registry.py:331`), from `--share` when local-only
  keys survive (`charter/secrets/registry.py:321`-`327`), and `remove_vault`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:350`). Commands: `purlis vault add`, `purlis vault
  remove`, `purlis persona create --vault` (`charter/commands_persona.py:141`).
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/registry.py:69` (`load_local`), `:95` (`load_registry`),
  `:228` (`scope_of`); `charter/statusline.py:799`.
- **Path:** `charter/config.py:794`.
- **Git:** gitignored via the `/.charter/` line in `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE`
  (`charter/commands.py:1094`, written by `_ensure_gitignore`, `charter/commands.py:1116`).
- **Encoding:** identical writer, mode **0600** (`charter/secrets/registry.py:209`).
  purlis (#434) replaces it whole, 0600 read back before a byte lands, or refuses the
  write — on a filesystem that cannot hold the mode as well as at a symlink.
- **Merge rule (the app must reproduce it):** shared is the base, local is layered **per
  field**; `config` is dict-updated key by key, other fields overwrite when not `None`
  (`charter/secrets/registry.py:104`-`116`). A `--share` publish REDUCES the local entry to
  its `LOCAL_ONLY_KEYS`, or deletes it (`charter/secrets/registry.py:316`-`327`).
  `scope_of` reports `shared` / `local` / `both` (`charter/secrets/registry.py:222`).

### `.charter/vaults/` (directory)

- **Status:** **stable** — the default home for plain-file and reference vault files, named
  by `config.VAULTS_DIR` (`charter/config.py:799`) and by the guard
  (`charter/hooks.py:553`).
- **Tier:** Clone state
- **Modes:** created 0700, **every level purlis itself creates** chmod'ed to 0700
  (`charter/secrets/base.py:61` → `charter/config.py:190` `private_mkdir`). A directory
  that already exists is left as found and merely *reported*
  (`charter/secrets/base.py:105` `loose_dirs`, rendered by `charter/secrets/base.py:195`).
- Measured on a plane generated for this survey (modes as purlis writes them, which is
  not what a git checkout of a fixture reproduces): `.charter` `drwx------`, `.charter/vaults` `drwx------`,
  every file inside `-rw-------`.
- File names: `<vault name>.json` and `<vault name>.meta.json` by default
  (`charter/commands_secrets.py:141`, `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:165`). Any other path
  is legal via `--file`, absolute included (`charter/secrets/base.py:40`).

Live-plane check (names and modes only, no contents): the real plane has
`.charter/vaults.json` and a `.charter/vaults/` directory of `<name>.json` /
`<name>.meta.json` files, all `0600`, matching the fixture.

### `.charter/vaults/<name>.json` — plain-file vault

- **Format:** flat JSON object, `key → secret value` (values may be multi-line).
- **Status:** **stable** — the operator may hand-author it, and the file is the vault.
- **Tier:** Clone state — at its default path, `.charter/vaults/<name>.json`. A vault added with `--file` can be anywhere, inside the plane or outside it, and it is Clone state only when it is inside `.charter/`. **It holds values**, so FR-10 never copies it, wherever it is. A restore brings back the vault's registry entry, marks the vault **file missing**, and names it to the operator; it never drops the entry silently.
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:97` (`_save`) →
  `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:42` (`_write_private`). Commands: `purlis secret set`,
  `purlis secret rm`.
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:29` (`_load`) — `get`, `keys`, `health`,
  `ages`; `charter/doctor.py` and the status line through `health()`.
- **Git:** default path gitignored via `/.charter/`. A `--file` path inside the plane that
  git does NOT ignore is refused at registration (`charter/commands_secrets.py:159`-`170`,
  using `git check-ignore`).
- **Encoding:** `json.dump(payload, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)` + trailing newline
  (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:91`-`92`). Insertion order (i.e. previous file order,
  then newly-set keys appended). Mode 0600 settled on the **descriptor** and read back
  before any byte is written; a mode with any of `0o077` set is refused and nothing is
  written (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:72`-`87`). Not atomic (in-place truncate), no
  locking. `get` first tightens a loose mode (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:137`); the
  read-only paths report instead of repairing (`charter/secrets/base.py:214` `mode_note`).
  **In purlis** (#429) the vault is replaced whole, never written in place: the text
  goes to a temp file beside it (`.charter-generated.<name>.<pid>.<tag>.tmp`), created
  `0600` with its mode read back before any byte (the same refusal as above when it will
  not hold), flushed, renamed over the vault, and the directory flushed. A crash mid-write
  leaves the old vault whole. **A vault path that is a symlink is refused** ("it is a
  symlink … Nothing was written") and the file it points at is left alone; Python writes
  through the link. A read-only vault is still refused. The `.meta.json` sidecar, the
  keyring provider's `.keys.json` index and the reference vault below share this writer.

Shape with placeholder values:

```json
{
  "API_TOKEN": "fixture-not-a-secret",
  "KUBECONFIG": "fixture-not-a-secret\nline two\n"
}
```

### `.charter/vaults/<name>.meta.json` — rotation sidecar

- **Format:** JSON object `key → {"set_at": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`.
- **Status:** **stable** — read by `purlis secret audit` in a later process; holds no
  values, only key names and dates.
- **Tier:** Clone state
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:148` (`set`) and `:158` (`delete`) via the
  same `_write_private` (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:177`).
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:167` (`_load_meta`), `:182` (`ages`) →
  `charter/commands_secrets.py:496` (`cmd_secret_audit`).
- **Name derivation:** `<vault file stem> + ".meta.json"` in the vault file's own directory
  (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:165`) — so a `--file` outside the plane puts the sidecar
  outside too.
- **Git / encoding:** as the vault file (0600, indent 2, trailing newline). Date is
  `datetime.date.today().isoformat()` — **local date, no timezone**
  (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:148`).

```json
{ "API_TOKEN": { "set_at": "2026-09-17" } }
```

### `.charter/vaults/<name>.keys.json` — keyring vault's keys index

purlis only (ADR 0047); the Python charter has no keyring provider and never reads it.

- **Format:** JSON object: `service` (string, or `null` before the vault's first write; a
  vault made before the rename names `charter/<vault>/<id>`, and `rename-local`'s keychain copy
  points it at `purlis/<vault>/<id>` once every item read back the same there, RN-6) and
  `keys`, an object `key → {"size": <size band>, "updated": <RFC 3339 UTC, to the second>}`.
  **Never a value.** `size` is `fingerprint::size_band` of the value (`1–15 bytes`,
  `16–31 bytes`, … `1024+ bytes`), never its length.
- **`held`** (on a key, optional, `true` only): its item was written held to purlis's app, so
  only the app reads it without the person's confirmation (ADR 0047 as amended by ruling V90).
  Absent on every key written before, and on every key in a store with no such rule (Linux, a
  test build's stub): on macOS such a key's item is written again, held, the next time purlis
  reads it (one the `purlis` command made, the next time the command reads it).
- **`held_note`** (optional): `"due"` once purlis moved one of the vault's items under that
  rule and has not said so yet, `"said"` after the vault's next `purlis secret get`, `cp` or
  `exec` said it. It is said once.
- **Status:** **stable** — it is the only record of which keys a keyring vault holds and of
  the service its items live under: the keyring cannot be enumerated through the `keyring`
  crate. Deleting it strands the vault's items in the keyring, still there and unnamed.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the only record of which keys a keyring vault holds; the values are in the Keyring tier.
- **Written by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/keyring.rs` (`set_with`, `delete_with`, and
  `get_with` and `take_note` for `held` and `held_note`), after the keyring write succeeded, through the plain-file provider's `write_private` (0600,
  settled on the descriptor first). Commands: `purlis secret set`, `purlis secret rm`.
- **Read by:** the same module — `keys`, `listed`, `get`, `ages`, `health`. `secret list`,
  `vault list` and `secret audit` read only this file and never the keyring.
- **`service`:** `purlis/<vault>/<8 lowercase hex>`, made randomly at the vault's first write
  and written to this file BEFORE that first item is, so no item is ever under a service no
  index records. An index written before the rename names `charter/<vault>/<8 lowercase hex>`;
  during the rename window that is still read, and the vault's new keys go under it too, until
  the keychain copy (RN-6) moves the vault (#1261). A service that is not
  `purlis/<vault>/<id>` or `charter/<vault>/<id>` for THIS vault (or holds a control character)
  is refused as corrupt: the file is on disk, and one pointing at another program's item would make
  purlis read it.
- **Git / encoding:** under `.charter/`, so gitignored; indent 2, trailing newline, keys
  sorted.

```json
{
  "service": "charter/ops/3f9a2c1b",
  "keys": {
    "API_TOKEN": { "size": "16–31 bytes", "updated": "2026-09-24T11:32:17Z", "held": true }
  }
}
```

### `.charter/keyring-stub.json` — a test build's keyring

**Tier:** Clone state, transient — test builds only; it stands in for the Keyring tier.

In the state directory (`.charter/`, or `$CHARTER_HOME` when set). Written **only** by a fenced
build (every `cargo test` build, and the app's `e2e` build — `crates/purlis-core/src/fence.rs`),
which keeps a keyring vault's values here instead of in the
operating system's store, so no test can reach the operator's keychain. JSON object
`"<service>\n<account>" → value`, 0600. **It holds values in plaintext**; a build anyone is
given never writes it.

### `.charter/vaults/exec/` — a brokered run's credential files

**Tier:** Clone state, transient — one file per `--file` or `--dotenv` credential of a running brokered `secret exec`; it lives for that run.

A folder made `0700` by the app the first time a sandboxed chat's `purlis secret exec` asks it
for a `--file` or `--dotenv` credential (#1407, `crates/purlis-core/src/secrets/brokered.rs`).
Each file is `charter-secret-<12 random characters>`, `0600`, holding one value or one dotenv
body: **it holds values in plaintext** while the run lasts. It is inside the vaults folder,
which every sandboxed chat is denied, and only the run's own sandbox is given back a read of
its file. The run removes the file when the command ends. The app removes any it finds when it
opens the project, so one left by a crash or a kill does not outlive the next launch. The app
refuses to use the folder when the vaults folder or `exec/` is a link. FR-10 never copies it.

### `.charter/vaults/<name>.json` — reference vault (same path, different content)

- **Format:** flat JSON object, `key → reference URI`.
- **Status:** **stable** — designed to be committed by a team (it holds no values) and
  hand-edited.
- **Tier:** Clone state — Plane when a team commits it from a path outside `.charter/`.
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/reference.py:191` (`_save`). Commands: `purlis secret
  set <vault> <key> --value 'op://…'`, `purlis secret rm`.
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/reference.py:179` (`_load`) — `get`, `keys`, `health`,
  `reference_for`.
- **Encoding — differs from the plain-file writer and this matters to a byte-identical
  implementation:** `json.dumps(data, indent=2, sort_keys=True) + "\n"` written with
  `Path.write_text`, then `os.chmod(p, 0o600)` **after** the write
  (`charter/secrets/reference.py:194`-`195`). So: **sorted keys** here, insertion order in
  the plain-file vault; and the mode is applied after the content, not before. **In
  purlis** (#356) the encoding is unchanged but the write goes through the plain-file
  provider's writer: since #429 that replaces the file whole through a temp created
  `0600`, and refuses a vault path that is a symlink (see the plain-file vault above).
- **Git:** default path is under `.charter/` and therefore ignored; a team that commits
  these points `--file` at a tracked path, which is allowed for this provider (the
  unignored-path refusal is `plain-file` only, `charter/commands_secrets.py:159`).

```json
{
  "DEPLOY_TOKEN": "op://Engineering/deploy/token",
  "DB_PASSWORD": "vault://secret/data/app#DB_PASSWORD"
}
```

### Secret reference syntax

Registered schemes: `charter/secrets/reference.py:112`
(`_RESOLVERS = {"op", "vault", "browser"}`). A value that is not a string, or whose scheme
is not in that map, is not a reference (`charter/secrets/reference.py:130` `scheme_of`).

| Syntax | Resolved with | Validation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `op://<vault>/<item>/<field>` | `op read --no-newline <uri>` | netloc present and ≥2 path segments | `charter/secrets/reference.py:49` |
| `vault://<path>#<FIELD>` | `vault kv get -field=<FIELD> <path>` | path and fragment both non-empty | `charter/secrets/reference.py:58` |
| `browser://<session>/<source>/<name>` | `npx …` via `charter/browser.py` | `source` ∈ `browser.SESSION_SOURCES`; key is the rest of the path verbatim | `charter/secrets/reference.py:69` |

A resolved value has exactly one trailing `\n` stripped
(`charter/secrets/reference.py:277`). Resolution is bounded by
`RESOLVE_TIMEOUT = 60.0` (`charter/secrets/reference.py:127`).

**Consumption syntaxes** (CLI surface, not files, but they are what a harness's command
line carries): `--env NAME=<key>`, `--file ENVVAR=<key>` (0600 temp file, prefix
`charter-<vault>-<key>-`), `--dotenv ENVVAR=NAME:key` (0600 temp file, prefix
`charter-<vault>-dotenv-`, entries sharing an ENVVAR merged in flag order)
— `charter/commands_secrets.py:1060`, `:1078`, `:1106`, `:1123`.

### `.charter/fingerprint.key`

- **Format:** raw binary, exactly 32 bytes (`KEY_BYTES`, `charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:63`).
- **Status:** **stable** — key material. Losing it silently changes the `fp:` values this
  plane prints, and a purlis process computing one reads it. `charter/hooks.py:554` names
  the file among the paths a harness tool call is refused; that bounds what an agent does
  through the harness, not what a process on the machine can open. Deleting it is not free:
  it is regenerated on next use, and `fp:` values printed before it stop matching.
- **Tier:** Clone state — key material V2 names. Not derived: losing it changes every `fp:` value.
- **Written by:** `charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:105`-`114` (`_key`), lazily on first use.
  Created only by a command that masks a value — `purlis secret get` (without `--reveal`),
  `purlis secret set` does **not** create it (measured: after `secret set` the file was
  absent; after `secret get` it appeared, 32 bytes, `-rw-------`).
- **Read by:** `charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:91` (`_key`) → `fingerprint()`
  (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:122`) → `masked()` (`:166`) →
  `charter/commands_secrets.py:604`.
- **Path:** `config.STATE_DIR / "fingerprint.key"` (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:65`,
  `:76`). **Git:** ignored with the rest of `.charter/`.
- **Encoding:** `os.urandom(32)`, no newline; 0600 fchmod'ed and read back before the write,
  refusing on any `0o077` bit; a file of the wrong length is regenerated
  (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:94`, `:111`). purlis (#434) replaces the key whole
  (temp beside, created 0600 and read back, fsync, rename) and refuses a key that is a
  symlink; a crash mid-write leaves the old file.
- **Fingerprint format on output:** `fp:` + first 12 hex chars of
  `HMAC-SHA256(key, value.encode("utf-8"))` (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:134`). The
  masked line is `<size band> · fp:<12 hex>`, or just the band when no key can be made
  (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:169`). Size bands: `empty`, `1–15 bytes`, then
  power-of-two bands `16–31`, `32–63`, … up to `1024+ bytes`, counted in UTF-8 bytes, with
  an **en dash** (`charter/secrets/fingerprint.py:155`-`163`).

### 1Password provider — not a file, but a shape another implementation must match

One item per purlis vault, its concealed fields are the secrets
(`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:552` `_write`):

```json
{"title": "charter-<vault>", "category": "PASSWORD",
 "tags": ["purlis", "purlis:<vault>"],
 "fields": [{"id": "<existing id or key>", "label": "<key>",
             "type": "CONCEALED", "value": "…"}]}
```

Title default `charter-<vault>` (`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:149`), tag literals from
`_TAG = "charter"` / `_CATEGORY = "PASSWORD"` (`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:99`, `:102`),
vault tag `charter:<vault>` (`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:159`). purlis now writes the tags
`purlis` and `purlis:<vault>` on every create and edit (#1261), so an item written before the
rename carries `charter` / `charter:<vault>` until its next write; tags are never used to find an
item, which is found by title, and the title stays `charter-<vault>`. Fields sorted by key
(`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:567`). Reads go through `op read --no-newline
op://<op-vault>/<op-item>/<key>` (`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:223`). Legacy
one-item-per-key titles `charter-<vault>-<key>` are detected and reported, never written
(`charter/secrets/onepassword.py:156`, `:581`).

### Guarded paths

`charter/hooks.py:553` — `_VAULT_PATH_RE` matches `.charter/vaults…`, `.charter/browser`,
`.charter/active-`, `.charter/fingerprint`, case-insensitively and in every separator
spelling; `charter/toolgate.py:276` guards `config.STATE_DIR` and `config.VAULTS_DIR` plus
each registered vault's own `file` (`charter/toolgate.py:301`, `:322`). Observed: a
`cat .charter/vaults/<name>.json` tool call was denied by purlis's own PreToolUse guard,
and a differently-shaped shell command reading the same path in another session was not.
The guard reads the shape of a tool call, which is what it says of itself (`docs/hooks.md`,
"When a guard is wrong") — so this section records the paths it names, not a boundary around
the bytes. A rebuild that reimplements the guard reproduces the matching, and inherits the
same bound.

## Files purlis writes that a harness reads

### 2a. Inside the plane

### `<plane>/.claude/settings.json`

- **Format:** JSON object (Claude Code's own schema; purlis owns three key paths).
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, operator-owned, read by Claude Code itself.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed and operator-owned.
- **Written by (each key IF ABSENT, never a repair):**
  - `hooks.PreToolUse[]` ← `_GUARD_HOOK` (`charter/commands.py:1186`), by
    `charter/commands.py:1233` (`_ensure_guard_hook`), from `purlis init` /
    `purlis reinit`. **Skipped entirely when an enabled purlis plugin already dispatches
    `charter hook pretooluse`** (`charter/commands.py:1258` via
    `charter/commands.py:1197` → `doctor._plugin_declaring_guard`, which always asks about
    `~/.claude`, not `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).
  - `env.CHARTER_HARNESS = "claude-code"` ← `charter/commands.py:2256`
    (`ensure_env_var`), called from `charter/harness/claude_code.py:335` (`wire`) through
    `_wire_harnesses` (`charter/commands.py:2296`).
  - `permissions.ask[]` / `permissions.allow[]` ← `charter/commands.py:1686`
    (`add_permission_rule`), from `purlis guard ask|allow` and, for the one rule `init`
    writes, `ensure_handoff_gate` (`charter/commands.py:2098`, pattern
    `charter/commands.py:1398`).
  - `enabledPlugins` is **written by the `claude` CLI**, not by purlis (see 2b).
- **Read by:** Claude Code; purlis reads it back at `charter/commands.py:1636`
  (`_load_settings`), `charter/harness/claude_code.py:402`, `charter/commands.py:2139`
  (`_rules_in`), `charter/doctor.py`.
- **Git:** committed — explicitly NOT ignored (`charter/commands.py:1098`-`1099`).
- **Encoding:** parsed **as Claude Code parses it** (`NaN`/`Infinity` rejected) —
  `charter/commands.py:1652` → `doctor._json_as_claude_code_parses`; an unparseable file is
  refused whole, never rewritten. Re-dumped through `_json_style`
  (`charter/commands.py:1320`), which copies the file's existing indent and separators, and
  the trailing newline is preserved only if the file had one
  (`charter/commands.py:1305`-`1306`, `charter/commands.py:2291`). `add_permission_rule`
  always appends `"\n"` (`charter/commands.py:1741`). A fresh file is
  `json.dumps(..., indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/commands.py:1265`).

| Key path purlis owns | Value | Merge rule | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hooks.PreToolUse[]` | `{"matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "charter hook pretooluse", "timeout": 10}]}` | append once; skipped if the plugin declares it | stable | `charter/commands.py:1186` |
| `env.CHARTER_HARNESS` | `"claude-code"` | set IF ABSENT; an `env` that is not an object is left alone | stable | `charter/commands.py:2279` |
| `permissions.ask[]` | e.g. `"Bash(purlis report *--yes*)"` | append IF ABSENT; wrong-typed block ⇒ `malformed`, no write | stable | `charter/commands.py:1727`-`1737` |
| `permissions.allow[]` | e.g. `"Bash(gh pr view *)"` | same | stable | `charter/commands.py:1832` |
| `enabledPlugins."charter@charter"` | `true` | written by `claude plugin install`, mirrored by purlis into workspaces | stable | `charter/harness/claude_code.py:53` |

**Rule syntax** (`charter/commands.py:1367` `_as_rule`): a bare command becomes
`Bash(<pattern>)`; a string already matching `Tool(...)` for
`_RULE_TOOLS` (`charter/commands.py:1345`), a bare tool name, or `mcp__[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`
(`charter/commands.py:1354`) is written verbatim; an `mcp__…` pattern with a wildcard or
arguments raises `UnexpressibleRule` and nothing is written.

**Default ask rules** (charter-app): `init` writes two, `Bash(purlis report *--yes*)` and
`Bash(purlis *todo*promote*)`, each under both names the command line has. The first is new in
purlis (ADR 0059, amended 2026-09-26), the second with `purlis ws todo promote` (V42,
ADR 0088 §5): `purlis`, then `todo`, then `promote`, with anything between, so it holds for
`ws` and `workspace` and for a `-w` or `--repo` on either side of the verb. `reinit` adds
both to a plane that predates them. **Until #1444 `init` wrote a third, `Bash(charter handoff *)`.**
A handoff is a dispatch now and its consent is the dispatch grant, so `init` writes no rule for
one, `reinit` gives a plane that still carries it no `purlis` twin, and
`purlis doctor --fix handoff-rule` removes exactly that rule (`permissions.ask` here,
`permission.bash` in `opencode.json`), leaving and naming any other rule about a handoff. `opencode.json` gets the same globs, each
placed so that no allow or ask that matches the same command comes after it (opencode's last
match wins). A **project template** (FR-17) adds its stack's guard defaults the same way,
through `purlis guard ask`'s writer (every harness with command permissions or none, then
every workspace layer). Codex's command rules live in `CODEX_HOME` or a trusted project's `.codex/rules`, which purlis does not write, so purlis's own guard applies there:
the commands that publish or deploy, such as `Bash(cargo publish *)` for Rust or
`Bash(twine upload *)` for Python. The list is each template's `[guard] ask` in
`crates/purlis-core/templates/<stack>/template.toml`, and a monorepo's is its own and every
stack's.

Measured after `init` + `guard ask 'terraform apply *'`, before #1444, when `init` still wrote
the handoff rule:

```json
{ "env": {"PURLIS_HARNESS": "claude-code"},
  "permissions": {"ask": ["Bash(purlis handoff *)", "Bash(terraform apply *)"]},
  "enabledPlugins": {"charter@charter": true} }
```
(no `hooks` block — the plugin install ran first, which is `init`'s deliberate order,
`charter/commands.py:2822`.)

### `<plane>/.claude/settings.local.json`

- **Tier:** Clone state — gitignored, and co-written by Claude Code.
- **Format / status:** as above, **stable** (Claude Code reads it, at the session directory
  **and at the git root**, measured on 2.1.267 — `charter/harness/claude_code.py:76`-`95`).
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:1686` with `local=True`
  (`charter/commands.py:1720`), from `purlis guard ask|allow --local`. Path constant
  `charter/commands.py:1766`.
- **Read by:** Claude Code; purlis via `_load_json_settings`
  (`charter/commands.py:1666`), `charter/harness/claude_code.py:403`.
- **Git:** gitignored — baseline line `/.claude/settings.local.json`
  (`charter/commands.py:1771`), also backfilled at the moment a `--local` rule is written
  (`charter/commands.py:1774`).
- **Encoding:** identical writer. Fixture: `{"permissions": {"allow": ["Bash(gh pr view *)"]}}`.

### `<plane>/opencode.json`

- **Format:** JSON object (opencode's schema).
- **Status:** **stable** — committed, read by opencode at the repository root.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/opencode.py:1183` (`_apply_rule`) → written at
  `charter/harness/opencode.py:1279`; reached from `purlis guard ask|allow` (never
  `--local`, which opencode answers `unsupported`, `charter/harness/opencode.py:1171`).
- **Read by:** opencode; purlis at `charter/harness/opencode.py:479`
  (`_configured_plugins`, for the foreign-plugin report).
- **Git:** committed (nothing ignores it).
- **Encoding:** `json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/harness/opencode.py:1266`) —
  **no `_json_style` equivalent**, so an existing file is re-dumped at indent 2.
  Unparseable ⇒ `malformed`, nothing written.
- **Key paths purlis owns:** `permission.<tool>.<glob> = "ask"|"allow"`, or for the five
  `FLAT_ONLY_PERMISSIONS` (`charter/harness/opencode.py:142`) `permission.<tool> =
  "ask"|"allow"` and only when the glob is `*` (anything else is `unsupported`,
  `charter/harness/opencode.py:1250`). Pattern translation
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:992` `ask_rule`): `mcp__<server>__<tool>` →
  (`<server>_<tool>`, `*`); `Tool(pattern)`/`tool(pattern)` → (`<opencode tool id>`,
  `pattern`) using `TOOL_NAMES` (`charter/harness/opencode.py:47`); anything else →
  (`bash`, pattern).
- **Never weaker than a deny (purlis, FR-17's review).** opencode decides a command by
  the **last** rule in `permission.bash` that matches it ("Rules are evaluated by pattern
  match, with the last matching rule winning", opencode.ai/docs/permissions), so where Python
  appends, `crates/purlis-core/src/scaffold/settings.rs` `ensure_opencode_rule` leaves an exact
  `"deny"` for the glob as it is (answered `denied`, said by `purlis guard ask`, and listed in
  a template's `denied`), and puts a **new** glob before the first `"deny"` entry, so every deny
  that matches the same command still comes after it and still decides, **except** that it
  goes right after the last non-deny entry whose pattern matches the glob's own text (`"cargo
  *": "allow"` for `cargo publish *`), so in an allowlist an allow that would answer the same
  command never comes after it; a deny written after that entry still decides. An entry
  already there with another decision (an `allow` made an `ask`) changes where it stands, as
  Python changes it, unless a later non-deny entry matches it; then it is moved by the same
  rule, so that broader allow cannot outrank it. A `deny` is appended. Claude Code weighs `deny` before `ask` and `allow` whatever the order, so its
  writer only says an exact deny and adds nothing beside it.
- Fixture (from before #1444, when `init` wrote the handoff rule): `{"permission": {"bash": {"purlis handoff *": "ask", "terraform apply *": "ask"}}}`.

### `<plane>/.gitignore` (the lines purlis owns)

- **Status:** **stable** — committed, read by git and by the operator.
- **Tier:** Plane — committed.
- **Written by:** `charter/commands.py:1116` (`_ensure_gitignore`, `init`) from the baseline
  at `charter/commands.py:1087`; backfilled additively by
  `charter/commands.py:1774` (`--local` rules) and `charter/commands.py:1806`
  (`purlis reinit`, `/charter.local.toml`), both through `util.append_gitignore`
  (`charter/util.py:472`).
- **Lines purlis owns:** `/workspaces/*/*`, `!/workspaces/.gitkeep`, `/.charter/`,
  `/.claude/settings.local.json`, `/charter.local.toml`, `/sessions/` (purlis, ADR 0064),
  plus the Python/OS block in the
  baseline. Presence is tested per line (whole-line, except `.charter/` which is a substring
  test) — `charter/commands.py:1133`-`1141`. Never removed or reordered.
  (The managed live-workspace block `# >>> purlis live workspaces …` is
  `charter/workspace.py:1338` — the workspace area's.)

### Generated harness layer in `workspaces/<ws>/` and in clones

One generic materialiser (`charter/workspace.py:2737` `_materialise`), driven by each
harness's `workspace_files` / `checkout_files` (`charter/workspace.py:2020`
`_harness_files`), refusing any relative path that escapes the base
(`charter/workspace.py:2044`-`2047`).

#### `workspaces/<ws>/.claude/settings.json` (generated)

- **Status:** **stable** — read by Claude Code for a chat whose cwd is the workspace
  directory (project settings do not walk up).
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — regenerated from the plane at the next launch.
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/claude_code.py:447` (`workspace_files`) →
  `charter/workspace.py:2649` (`wire_harnesses`), called from `workspace.scaffold`/`ensure`
  on every launch, from `purlis workspace reinit`, and from `purlis guard ask` via
  `charter/commands.py:1909` (`_mirror_into_workspaces`).
- **Content:** exactly the plane's own `enabledPlugins` and `env` keys
  (`WORKSPACE_KEYS`, `charter/harness/claude_code.py:53`), plus `permissions` filtered to
  `ask`/`deny` only (`RESTRICTIVE_BUCKETS`, `charter/harness/claude_code.py:67`;
  `allow` never travels). Key order: the two mirrored keys in `WORKSPACE_KEYS` order,
  `permissions` appended last (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:484`).
- **Encoding:** `json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:485`);
  written whole through tmp+fsync+`os.replace` (`charter/workspace.py:2874` `_write_whole`).
  Empty plane settings ⇒ **no file at all**.
- **Git:** inside `workspaces/<ws>/`, already ignored by `/workspaces/*/*`.

#### `workspaces/<ws>/<repo>/.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` (generated, in a clone)

**Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — purlis's part; Claude Code co-writes the local file.

- Same generator; a clone additionally gets `checkout_files`
  (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:487`): `{"permissions": {<ask/deny from the plane's
  LOCAL file>}}` as `json.dumps(..., indent=2) + "\n"`
  (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:499`). `allow` never travels, which is why the fixture
  clone got no local file.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` is also **co-written by Claude Code itself** ("don't ask
  again"), so it is listed in `cowritten` (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:387`) and is
  never rewritten once the harness has edited it (`charter/workspace.py:3336`).

#### Mirrored plane paths in a clone

**Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — copies of committed plane content.

`charter/workspace.py:2077` (`_inherited_files`) copies, 1:1 as text, every registered
harness's `inherited_paths`: `.claude/agents`, `.claude/skills`
(`charter/harness/claude_code.py:169`), `.opencode/agent`
(`charter/harness/opencode.py:831`), `.codex/skills`
(`charter/harness/codex.py:236`). **`CLAUDE.md` is deliberately never generated or
mirrored, and `AGENTS.md` is never mirrored.** The one project-instructions file purlis
writes is the next heading's `AGENTS.md`, in a piece only (ADR 0085).

#### `<piece>/AGENTS.md`: a chat's guidance, in its own worktree

**Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — rendered from persona files when a chat starts.

- **Written by:** `purlis_core::start::layered_or_refusal` → `guest::wire_for_chat`, when a
  chat starts in a piece (`workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/<repo>/<piece>`). Never in a clone, a
  workspace directory or the project root (ADR 0085).
- **Format:** Markdown with no frontmatter. The first line is `<!-- GENERATED by charter for
  one chat, from its persona and its piece. Edit the persona, not this file. -->`, followed by
  `# purlis's briefing for this chat`, and then the allowed briefing blocks, separated by blank
  lines (`briefing::agents_md`):
  - the persona's identity, without its memory digest. It names `personas/<name>/persona.md`,
    a project-relative path that does not resolve inside the repository;
  - the first line of the piece note, which `agents_md` cuts itself.

  It never carries memory, session records, todos, other workspaces, the skills listing or a
  path on this machine.
- **Ownership:** one entry in the piece's `.charter-generated`, and the line `/AGENTS.md` in
  purlis's block in the common `info/exclude`, written before the file is (V35; git has no
  per-worktree exclude). purlis rewrites the file only while its digest is the recorded one.
- **The line hides every worktree root's `AGENTS.md`, the clone's included.** So `purlis
  doctor` (the `hidden AGENTS.md` row, shown only when there is something to say), a notice on
  the chat's pane at every start from the picker (`start::Ready::notices`), and every chat's
  briefing name each untracked `AGENTS.md` that the line hides and purlis did not write
  (`guest::hidden_agents_md`). A place the check could not look is said too, never passed over.
- **Two chats starting in one piece take turns**: an `flock` on the piece's own git directory
  (`.git/worktrees/<id>/`), which is no file and no store.
- **Steps aside, and never refuses a chat.** It is not written where:
  - the repository tracks an `AGENTS.md`;
  - an `AGENTS.md` purlis did not write is there.

  It is withheld where:
  - the exclude cannot be written at all;
  - its exclude line was left out (charter#1072).

  A merge that brings in a tracked `AGENTS.md` replaces purlis's excluded file (measured on
  git 2.50.1), and the next start writes nothing.

#### `<workspace-or-checkout>/.charter-generated`

- **Format:** JSON object, `relative path → sha256 hex` (a **list** of hexes while a write
  is pending) — `charter/workspace.py:2440` (`_recorded`), `charter/workspace.py:2806`.
- **Status:** **stable** — it is the ownership record two processes (a launch and `doctor`)
  read, and deleting it makes purlis treat every generated file as foreign: nothing is
  overwritten, exclude lines are dropped, `doctor` reports the layer as not purlis's.
- **Tier:** Clone state — not rebuildable, for the reason its workspace entry gives.
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:2933` (`_publish_marker`) →
  `_write_whole` with `json.dumps(marker, indent=2) + "\n"`
  (`charter/workspace.py:2946`). Removed when it would name nothing (`:2948`).
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:2212` (`_read_marker_at`) — the next launch, `doctor`,
  `purlis workspace reinit`, `unwire_guest`.
- **Git:** never committed; in a clone it is hidden via `info/exclude`. A marker git
  **tracks** is distrusted whole (`charter/workspace.py:2176`), as is one holding an
  absolute/`..` key (`charter/workspace.py:2155`).
- **Digest:** `sha256(text)` of the text purlis wrote, hex (`charter/workspace.py:1938`).
- Fixture: `{ ".claude/settings.json": "08dcdf9e…" }`.

#### `<clone>/.git/info/exclude` — purlis's managed block

- **Status:** **stable** — read by git in a repo purlis does not own; the operator sees it.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — the managed block is rewritten on every launch and repair.
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:3876` (`_register_excludes`) →
  `_replace_block` (`charter/workspace.py:3404`) → `_write_whole`. Reached from
  `wire_guest` (`charter/workspace.py:4059`), i.e. every launch, `purlis clone`
  (`charter/commands.py:483` `_wire_clones`) and `purlis workspace reinit`.
- **Shape** (`charter/workspace.py:3384` `_exclude_block`): begin marker
  `# >>> purlis (generated layer — `purlis workspace reinit`) >>>`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3114`), the three `_EXCLUDE_NOTE` comment lines
  (`charter/workspace.py:3118`), one `/`-anchored line per generated path in
  `_shared_rels` order, the unanchored temp glob `.charter-generated.*.tmp`
  (`charter/workspace.py:3381`), then `# <<< purlis <<<` (`charter/workspace.py:3115`),
  and a trailing newline. Idempotent: the block is replaced, never appended; an
  unterminated block runs to EOF and is replaced whole. A file with no purlis block and
  nothing to add is handed back byte for byte (`charter/workspace.py:3424`-`3425`).
- The block, verbatim, as purlis writes it:
  `/.claude/settings.json`, `/.charter-generated`, `.charter-generated.*.tmp`.
- **Temp files:** every write in a checkout goes through
  `.charter-generated.<pid>.<hex12>.tmp` beside the target, fsynced, then `os.replace`,
  keeping the replaced file's mode (`charter/workspace.py:2913`-`2924`). **In purlis**
  (#430) the temp is `.charter-generated.<name>.<pid>.<hex12>.tmp`, which the same glob
  hides; the replaced file's mode is kept (it used to come back at the umask's), the
  directory is flushed after the rename, and a generated file that is read-only or is itself
  a symlink is refused and reported blocked.

### 2b. Outside the plane (machine-global)

### `~/.config/opencode/plugin/charter.ts` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honoured)

- **Since the rename (#1266):** `charter plugin install` writes its guard as
  `plugin/purlis.ts` and removes this file when charter or the Python charter wrote it, so
  opencode never loads two.
- **Format:** TypeScript module, generated from `_SHIM_TEMPLATE`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:244`, rendered at `charter/harness/opencode.py:403`).
- **Status:** **stable** — opencode loads it; it is what sets `$CHARTER_HARNESS` and routes
  every tool call to `charter hook <handler>`.
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable — `purlis plugin install` writes it again.
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/opencode.py:626` (`ensure_shim`, create-only) and
  `charter/harness/opencode.py:588` (`refresh_shim`, which replaces a shim stamped with an
  **older** purlis version), from `charter/harness/opencode.py:956` (`wire`) via
  `_wire_harnesses` (`init`, `reinit`, `purlis harness install`), and from `upgrade`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:921`).
- **Read by:** opencode. purlis compares it **byte for byte** to `SHIM_BYTES`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:417`, `:441`) and refuses to overwrite anything it cannot
  vouch for (`charter/harness/opencode.py:537` `unvouched`).
- **Git:** outside every repo.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 bytes written with `write_bytes`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:622`, `:638`). First line is the stamp
  `// charter-version: <version>` (`charter/harness/opencode.py:401`). The embedded tables
  are `json.dumps(..., indent=2, sort_keys=True)` for `TOOL_NAMES`, `PRE_HOOKS`,
  `POST_HOOKS` and plain `json.dumps` for `DEFAULT_PRE_HOOK` / `EFFECTFUL_TOOLS`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:405`-`409`). **The file's bytes therefore change with every
  purlis version** and with any change to those four tables.
- **Realm rule:** anything else in `plugin/` is foreign and reported
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:501`), because opencode loads the whole directory into one
  module realm.

### `~/.config/opencode/command/charter.md`

- **Format:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`description:`), body embeds
  `` !`echo '{}' | charter statusline` ``.
- **Status:** **stable** — opencode reads it as the `/charter` command.
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/opencode.py:984` (`wire`), **create-only** (never
  refreshed). Constant: `charter/harness/opencode.py:225` (`COMMAND`), path
  `charter/harness/opencode.py:221`.
- **Git:** outside every repo. **Encoding:** the constant verbatim, trailing newline
  included.

### `~/.config/opencode/charter-context.md`

- **Format:** Markdown; an HTML comment header then `hooks.context_block(None)`.
- **Status:** **stable** — opencode reads it (it is named in `instructions`), and it is the
  substitute for a SessionStart hook.
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/opencode.py:642` (`write_context`) — **always
  overwritten**, the one generated file purlis repairs; called from `wire`
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:986`).
- **Encoding:** `"<!-- Generated by charter. Do not edit: rewritten whenever the plane's
  state changes. -->\n\n" + body.strip() + "\n"`, or `_No control-plane context._` when the
  body is empty (`charter/harness/opencode.py:655`-`657`). **Content is plane state** —
  active workspace, todos, personas — so it is nondeterministic by design.

### `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`

- **Status:** **stable** — opencode's own global config.
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable — opencode's own file; only purlis's keys are rebuilt.
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/opencode.py:660` (`ensure_instructions`): appends the
  **absolute** path of `charter-context.md` to `instructions`, IF ABSENT
  (`charter/harness/opencode.py:683`). Unparseable or wrong-typed ⇒ `malformed`, nothing
  written.
- **Encoding:** `json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n"` (`charter/harness/opencode.py:685`).
- Fixture: `{"instructions": ["<abs path>/charter-context.md"]}`.

### `~/.codex/config.toml` (`$CODEX_HOME` honoured)

- **Format:** TOML; purlis appends **whole tables or nothing**.
- **Status:** **stable** — Codex reads it; it is machine-wide.
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable — Codex's own file; only purlis's lines are rebuilt.
- **Written by:** `charter/harness/codex.py:100` (`install`) → `p.write_text(raw + sep +
  _block())` (`charter/harness/codex.py:141`). **Only** from `purlis harness install
  codex` / a Codex profile (`charter/commands_harness.py:169`); `CodexHarness.wire` writes
  nothing on purpose (`charter/harness/codex.py:295`).
- **Read by:** Codex; purlis at `charter/harness/codex.py:126` and
  `charter/wiring.py:506` (`_codex`).
- **Block written** (`charter/harness/codex.py:82` `_block`), appended with a separating
  newline only when the file does not end in one (`charter/harness/codex.py:140`):

```toml

[shell_environment_policy]
set = { PURLIS_HARNESS = "codex" }
```

- **Refusals:** a config already declaring `hooks.<event>` (other than `hooks.state`) ⇒
  `doubled`, nothing written (`charter/harness/codex.py:132`-`136`); an existing
  `shell_environment_policy` ⇒ `present`, nothing written (`charter/harness/codex.py:137`).
- **Keys purlis READS but never writes:** `plugins."charter@charter".enabled`,
  `hooks.state."charter@charter:hooks/hooks.json:<event>:<group>:<hook>".trusted_hash`
  (`charter/wiring.py:634` `_codex_marks`, `charter/wiring.py:92` `CODEX_TRUST_PREFIX`).

### `<chat temp dir>/purlis-ssh/` — a chat's ssh route

- **Format:** `config` (an ssh configuration, `0600`) and `bin/ssh` (a POSIX shell script,
  `0700`).
- **Tier:** Machine, device-bound, rebuildable — written again for every confined chat as it starts, and removed with the chat's own temp directory when it ends.
- **Written by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/sandbox/tunnel.rs` (`SshRoute::write`), for each chat
  whose network goes through purlis's proxy, and for each brokered `secret exec` (#1667).
  Handed only to a harness purlis's sandbox wraps whole (Codex, opencode) and to a brokered
  run: a Claude Code chat's harness runs outside its sandbox, so this folder, which a chat may
  write, is never on its `PATH` (`Applied::ssh_route`).
- **What it says:** every ssh connection leaves through the chat's SOCKS port
  (`ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:<port> %h %p`), shares no master connection,
  and then reads the person's own `~/.ssh/config`. `bin/ssh` runs `/usr/bin/ssh -F` with it;
  the chat's `PATH` starts with `bin/`, and its `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` names that `ssh`. No key,
  agent or value is in either file.

### Claude Code's own files — purlis does NOT write them

**Tier:** None — Claude Code's files. The one exception is purlis's `purlis plugin install`
(ADR 0057), which does write `~/.claude/settings.json`: `extraKnownMarketplaces.charter-app` and
`enabledPlugins["charter@charter-app"]`, and it removes its entry from
`plugins/known_marketplaces.json` on uninstall (`crates/purlis-core/src/plugin_install.rs`,
`ClaudeCode`). Those keys are Machine, device-bound and rebuildable, like its opencode and Codex
lines above; the rest of this section is the Python charter's.

`~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`,
`~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude.json` are written by the `claude` binary. purlis
shells out — `claude plugin marketplace add purlis/purlis` then `claude plugin install
charter@charter --scope project -y` (`charter/plugincache.py:335`-`336`,
`charter/plugincache.py:112`, `:131`) — from `Harness.provision`
(`charter/harness/claude_code.py:338`), i.e. only `purlis init` and `purlis doctor
--fix`. The module docstring states the rule explicitly: *"Everything here talks to `claude
plugin … --json`, never to Claude Code's files"* (`charter/plugincache.py:27`-`32`).
purlis reads them only as **mtime/size stamps** for its wiring cache
(`charter/wiring.py:775` `_claude_stamps`).

Measured in a throwaway `$HOME` after `purlis init` (written by `claude`, shape recorded here
because a Rust implementation will read the same entries through the CLI):

| File | Entry purlis cares about | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `plugins/installed_plugins.json` | `plugins["charter@charter"][] = {scope, installPath, version, installedAt, lastUpdated, gitCommitSha, projectPath}` | `charter/plugincache.py:196` (`_our_entries`), `:257` (`covers`) |
| `plugins/known_marketplaces.json` | `charter.source = {source: "github", repo: "purlis/purlis"}`, `installLocation` | `charter/plugincache.py:456` (`marketplace_clone`) |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | `extraKnownMarketplaces.charter` — written by `claude`, never by purlis | `charter/commands.py:1240` (names it as a key purlis must not touch) |
| `~/.claude.json` | `mcpServers`; deliberately NOT stamped, because the probe itself writes this file | `charter/harness/claude_code.py:221`, `charter/wiring.py:822` |

Config-folder resolution a second implementation must copy exactly:
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? ~/.claude`, NFC-normalised, **empty value kept**
(`charter/harness/claude_code.py:192`); but for `.claude.json` it is
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR || ~`, un-normalised, with a legacy `<config home>/.config.json`
winning while it exists (`charter/harness/claude_code.py:221`).

### The shipped plugin's `hooks/hooks.json`

- **Format:** JSON, `{"hooks": {<Event>: [{"matcher": …, "hooks": [{"type": "command",
  "command": "charter hook <handler> --plugin-version X.Y.Z", "timeout": N}]}]}}`.
- **Status:** **stable** — it is the file Claude Code and Codex dispatch from, and Codex
  numbers its trust-ledger keys `<event>:<group>:<hook>` against the **installed copy**
  (`charter/wiring.py:573` `_codex_guard_keys`, `charter/wiring.py:613`
  `_guard_positions`). It lives in the purlis repo (release artifact), not in a plane.
- **Tier:** None — shipped inside the app bundle, not a store.
- **Read by:** the harness; purlis at `charter/wiring.py:601` (the installed copy under
  `<CODEX_HOME>/plugins/cache/charter/charter/<version>/hooks/hooks.json`) and
  `charter/hooks.py:8986` (`--plugin-version` skew check).
- At `50d31dc`: SessionStart 1, UserPromptSubmit 1, PreToolUse 4, PostToolUse 5, Stop 1,
  SubagentStop 1 groups.

### 2c. Git config purlis sets

- **Status:** **stable** — git reads it; it is per-repo `.git/config`.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — set again on every wiring.
- **Written by:** `charter/gitpolicy.py:170` (`apply`) → `git config --local …`
  (`charter/gitpolicy.py:190`, `:195`). Callers: `purlis clone`
  (`charter/commands.py:615`), `init --clone-this-repo` (`charter/commands.py:2558`),
  `purlis git-policy --apply` (`charter/commands.py:3301`).
- **Scope:** `--local` only — never `--global`/`--system` (`charter/gitpolicy.py:9`-`14`).
- **Keys, resolved per repo from its own forge** (`charter/gitpolicy.py:111` `forge_for`,
  default GitLab when there is no `origin`):

| Key | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `credential.helper` | `!<cli> auth git-credential` (`gh` or `glab`) | `charter/gitpolicy.py:45`, `charter/forge/github.py:488` |
| `commit.gpgsign` | `false` | `charter/gitpolicy.py:50` |
| `tag.gpgsign` | `false` | `charter/gitpolicy.py:51` |
| `url.https://<host>/.insteadOf` | added once per SSH form: `git@<host>:` and `ssh://git@<host>/` (`--add`, multi-valued) | `charter/gitpolicy.py:195`, `charter/forge/github.py:491` |

- Idempotent: a key is rewritten only when its **last** value differs; an insteadOf form is
  added only when absent (`charter/gitpolicy.py:186`-`196`). An unrecognised forge ⇒ nothing
  applied (`charter/gitpolicy.py:180`).
- **Read, never written:** `core.worktree` out of `<git dir>/config`, parsed by purlis's
  own mini-parser with a 262144-byte cap (`charter/gitconfig.py:71`, `:153`,
  `charter/gitconfig.py:61`); relative values resolve against the **git directory**
  (`charter/gitconfig.py:94`).

**Git config a clone or worktree made for a chat does not read.** A clone or a worktree the **app** makes for a sandboxed chat (`purlis clone` and `purlis
worktree add` run in a chat, ADR 0067 §2, #1335) runs git with **none of your git config**: no
global file (`~/.gitconfig`, `~/.config/git/config`) and no system file. Only your
`user.name` and `user.email` are passed on, on the command line. Your config routinely defines
programs a repository can ask git to run, and git run by the app runs outside the chat's
sandbox, so none is read. The same command in your own terminal reads your config as git
always does. Two differences show (#1413):

- **Filters do not run.** A repository whose `.gitattributes` names a filter (`filter=lfs`
  for Git LFS, or one of its own) is checked out as stored: for LFS, small pointer files in
  place of the real content. The answer says so for each filter a `.gitattributes` names,
  the top one's and each folder's (at most 64 files), read as the checkout's `HEAD` commits
  it (a regular file of at most 64 KiB; the working tree, which the chat writes, is never
  read). It names at most 8 filters, LFS first, and counts the rest in one sentence. For LFS, run `git lfs pull` in the checkout, from the chat or your terminal, to
  fetch the content.
- **Network settings do not apply.** `http.proxy`, `http.sslCAInfo`, `http.sslCAPath`,
  `http.sslVerify`, `http.sslCert`, `http.sslKey`, `http.cookieFile`, `http.extraHeader` (each
  also as `http.<url>.*`) and `url.<base>.insteadOf`
  rewrites are not read, so a clone can fail where your terminal's succeeds. When a clone made
  for a chat fails to reach its host (a name that does not resolve, a connection, a proxy, a
  certificate, or the host refusing the sign-in, as git itself reports it), purlis reads your
  global config files to see whether one of these keys would have changed the clone's route,
  and names the key, never its value. It reads them only to tell you and never applies them.
  Clone it in your own terminal (`purlis clone <repo>`) instead. A clone that fails for
  another reason, such as a repository the forge says is not there (a 404), names no key.
  This narrows who learns which keys you set; it does not stop it: a host that fails on
  purpose, with a certificate or a dropped connection, still has the keys named, never their
  values.

### 2d. Charter-private caches in this area

### `.charter/cache/harness-wiring.json`

- **Format:** JSON object, `sha256 key → {state, detail, fix, checked_at, stamp}`.
- **Status:** **internal** — written and read only by `charter/wiring.py` for the profile
  selector; deleting it costs one extra probe per profile (the selector re-probes on a
  miss, `charter/wiring.py:844`). A launch never reads it (`charter/wiring.py:849`).
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/wiring.py:870` (`remember`) →
  `config.write_for(path, json.dumps(doc, indent=2) + "\n")` (`charter/wiring.py:890`),
  under `config.private_mkdir` (`:889`). Only `wired`/`unwired` are stored.
- **Key:** `sha256(json.dumps({**profiletrust.fingerprint(p), "name", "cwd"},
  sort_keys=True))` (`charter/wiring.py:770`).
- **Stamp:** `{str(path): [st_mtime_ns, st_size] | null}` over each kind's stamped paths
  (`charter/wiring.py:820`; Claude Code `charter/wiring.py:786`, Codex
  `charter/wiring.py:807`, opencode `charter/wiring.py:815`).
- **Freshness:** `0 <= now - checked_at < 86400` (`charter/wiring.py:89`, `:858`).

### `.charter/unrecorded/<sha256[:32]>.json`

- **Format:** `{"errno": "<name or int>", "says": "<strerror>"}` + newline.
- **Status:** **stable** — written by the snapshot path to explain why a checkout's marker
  could not be published, and read by `doctor` in a different process
  (`charter/workspace.py:2984`); removed on the first successful publish. Deleting it costs
  the reason on one `doctor` row, and nothing else.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — recomputed on the next failed publish.
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:2977` (`_note_unrecorded`), path
  `charter/workspace.py:2956` (`config.STATE_DIR / "unrecorded" / f"{key}.json"`, key =
  `sha256(realpath(tree))[:32]`).

## `.charter/` — runtime state

Everything below lives under the plane's **state directory**. It is `<plane root>/.charter/`
unless `$CHARTER_HOME` is set, in which case it is that path **verbatim**
(`charter/config.py:110`, `charter/config.py:114`). A legacy `.edm/` is renamed to
`.charter/` once, on derivation (`charter/config.py:114`).

Out of scope here (other sections): `vaults.json`, `vaults/`, `fingerprint.key`
(secrets), `harness-profiles-launched.json` (config), `persona-state/`, `reports/`
(personas). They are named where a reader in this area touches them.

### Conventions that apply to every file in this area

**Modes.** Every directory purlis creates under the state dir is `0700`
(`config.private_mkdir`, `charter/config.py:190`); every file purlis writes there is
`0600`, settled with `fchmod` on the descriptor *before* any content
(`STATE_FILE_MODE`, `charter/config.py:389`). A Rust writer must do the same — purlis
does not re-tighten a pre-existing directory but does tighten a pre-existing file.

**Write primitives** (all dispatch on "is this path under the state dir"):

| Call | Semantics | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `config.write_for(p, data)` | whole-file write, truncate after `fchmod`, not atomic | `charter/config.py:504` |
| `config.replace_for(p, data)` | **atomic**: write `<name>.<pid>.<12 hex>.tmp` beside, then `os.replace` | `charter/config.py:595`, temp name `charter/config.py:592` |
| `config.create_for(p, data)` | `O_EXCL` create; returns False if it already existed | `charter/config.py:517` |
| `config.touch_for(p)` | create empty (append mode) + `os.utime` — the mtime is the payload | `charter/config.py:644` |
| `config.private_mkdir` / `claim_private_dir` | 0700 mkdir / `O_EXCL`-style claim of a directory | `charter/config.py:190`, `charter/config.py:283` |

**In purlis** (#430) the whole-file replaces — `replace_for`'s equivalent here (the
profile trust record, the push and save journals, hook state), and the plane's committed files,
`workspace.json`, the generated harness layer and the vaults — go through one writer, `purlis_core::rewrite::replace`. Its temp is
`.charter-generated.<name>.<pid>.<12 hex>.tmp` (the prefix a guest checkout's exclude block
already hides); it is flushed before the rename and the directory after it; a target that is a
symlink is refused rather than replaced; and the mode is one of four: kept (committed files),
kept-or-0600-when-new (the settings tab's files), 0600 (state here), or 0600-or-nothing
(vaults).

**Git.** The whole directory is gitignored: `purlis init` writes `/.charter/` into the
plane's `.gitignore` (`charter/commands.py:1096` in `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE`,
`charter/commands.py:1137` for the additive path). So **nothing in this area is committed**;
"stable" below never means "shared through git", it means "a second process reads it".

**Two id shapes are used as file/directory names**

* *session id* — `session.current()`: `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID` → `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`,
  stripped of every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (`charter/session.py:65`,
  `charter/session.py:25`). Inside a frame this is the **chat id** (`ide.2`), which shadows
  Claude Code's own session id (`charter/session.py:46`).
* *terminal id* — `session.terminal()`: `TERM_SESSION_ID` → `TMUX_PANE` → `STY` →
  `SSH_TTY` → `os.ttyname(0)`, with every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` replaced by
  `-` (`charter/session.py:73`, `charter/session.py:119`). So `%9` → `-9`,
  `/dev/ttys032` → `-dev-ttys032` (confirmed against the live plane).

### `sessions/` — per-session markers

**Tier:** Clone state, transient — every file below, unless its entry says otherwise.

*Collected (purlis):* when the app opens a plane, and each time `purlis workspace use` writes a
pointer, every marker here last written 30 days or more before is removed, except a `.tools`
ceiling and its `.gate` (collected at 7 days, see their entry) and the markers of a chat the
plane's reopen record will bring back (`retention::on_open`, `retention::on_select`; the rule is
under [Every store has a tier](#every-store-has-a-tier)).

### `sessions/<sid>.workspace`
- **Format:** plain text, one workspace name + `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — written by `purlis ws use` / the reconcile path, read by every
  other purlis process (status line, hooks, frame panels) to answer "which workspace is
  this session on".
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:823` (`set_active`), `charter/workspace.py:851`
  (`reconcile`, seeding from the terminal pointer); commands: `purlis workspace use|ws use`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:220`), `purlis workspace reconcile`
  (`charter/commands_workspace.py:1377`), frame launch (`charter/commands_frame.py:5535`)
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:66`/`for_session` (`charter/workspace.py:111`),
  `workspace.source` (`charter/workspace.py:669`), rename sweep
  (`charter/workspace.py:1450`), freshness scan (`charter/workspace.py:4431`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** value + trailing `\n`; non-atomic `write_for`; read is `.read_text().strip()`,
  empty → "no pointer"; name is re-validated on read (`instance.workspace_name_ok`).
- **Lifetime:** pruned when older than 30 days on any `set_active`
  (`_SESSION_MAX_AGE`, `charter/workspace.py:45`, sweep at `charter/workspace.py:887`), and
  in purlis also when the app opens the plane, unless a chat it will reopen is keyed on
  it (`retention::on_open`, see [Every store has a tier](#every-store-has-a-tier)).

### `sessions/<sid>.lock`
- **Format:** plain text, workspace name + `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — a second process (any later `purlis ws use`, the frame) reads it
  to refuse an unforced switch.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:824` (`set_active` — "confirming = locking")
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:766` (`is_locked`), removed by `unlock`
  (`charter/workspace.py:781`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** as `.workspace`. Inside a frame the *launch* lock outranks this file
  (`launch_lock` → `frame/state.own_workspace`, `charter/workspace.py:744`).

### `sessions/<sid>.tools` — the persona tool **ceiling**
- **Format:** JSON object `{"<persona>": ["<tool>", …]}`, `sort_keys=True`, no trailing newline
- **Status:** **stable** — written by the SessionStart hook, read by the PreToolUse guard in
  a *different* process, and by `purlis persona …`. Security-relevant: it is what a
  mid-session `tools:` edit cannot raise.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — a gate file: per session, and never backed up.
- **Written by:** `charter/toolgate.py:813` (`snapshot`), called from
  `charter/hooks.py:7620` (`sessionstart`)
- **Read by:** `charter/toolgate.py:857` (`frozen_tools`), `charter/commands_persona.py:411`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** `json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)`, written with `replace_for` (atomic).
  Present-but-unparseable ⇒ **approve nothing** (`charter/toolgate.py:859`).
- **Only narrows.** The gate grants what is in the live `tools:`, this ceiling **and** the
  grant approved on this machine (ADR 0035, *Grants*), so a stale or stray ceiling cannot widen
  anything.
- **Collected (purlis):** when the app opens a plane, a `<sid>.tools` and its `<sid>.gate`
  last written more than 7 days earlier are removed, the ceiling first
  (`personagate::sweep_ceilings`). A session that resumes takes a fresh one.

### `sessions/<sid>.gate` — "a ceiling was taken for this session"
- **Format:** empty file; existence is the whole payload
- **Status:** **stable** — a deliberately separate fact from `.tools`; deleting `.tools`
  alone must not re-snapshot (#443, `charter/toolgate.py:752`).
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — a gate file.
- **Written by:** `charter/toolgate.py:808` (`touch_for`, **before** the ceiling)
- **Read by:** `charter/toolgate.py:877` (`_ceiling_was_taken`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** zero bytes; write ordering matters (marker first, ceiling second).

### `sessions/<sid>.usage` — token/cache trend ring buffer
- **Format:** plain text, one CSV row per turn: `read,write,hit,ctx`; at most 16 rows
  (`_TREND_KEEP`, `charter/statusline.py:363`); trailing newline
- **Status:** **stable** — written by `charter statusline` (fed Claude Code's per-turn
  payload) and read by the frame's panels in another process
  (`recorded_context_gauge`, `charter/statusline.py:735`); `ctx` exists **only** here.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/statusline.py:414` (`_record_turn`), via
  `statusline.record_usage` (`charter/statusline.py:643`)
- **Read by:** `charter/statusline.py:459` (`_usage_rows`), `charter/statusline.py:467`,
  `charter/statusline.py:735`; panels through `frame/slots.py`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** `"\n".join(rows) + "\n"`; a row is appended only when `(read, write)`
  differs from the last row (`charter/statusline.py:408`); `ctx` may be the empty field
  (`…,100,`) meaning "no percentage", never `0`. 3-field rows (older purlis) still parse.
- **Keyed on Claude Code's own session id from the payload**, not on `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID`
  (`charter/statusline.py:616`) — so in a frame this file's name differs from the chat id.

### `sessions/<sid>.memnudge`
- **Format:** plain text, a decimal integer, no newline
- **Status:** **internal** — a counter written and read only by `hooks` (PostToolUse). Deleted
  ⇒ the memory-cadence nudge restarts its count at 0; nothing else changes.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:7689` (`_memnudge_set`), bumped `charter/hooks.py:7698`
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:7680`
- **Git:** gitignored

### `sessions/<sid>.configver`
- **Format:** plain text, a 40-char git sha + `\n`
- **Status:** **internal**, Python only — hooks-only baseline for the "control plane updated"
  nudge. Deleted ⇒ the next UserPromptSubmit re-baselines silently and nudges once less.
  purlis writes none: the window marks a chat's tab when `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/*.md` or a `personas/*/persona.md` changed after it
  started, from what it read of them at the chat's start, and keeps that in memory
  (charter#369).
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:7875` (`_write_configver`)
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:7891`
- **Git:** gitignored

### `sessions/<sid>.<tool_use_id>.<kind>.ask-pending`
- **Format:** empty file; existence is the payload. `<kind>` ∈ `routing-ask`, `dispatch-ask`
  (`_ASK_KINDS`, `charter/hooks.py:213`)
- **Status:** **internal** — written by one hook event and taken by another in the same
  chat, purely to trace "the operator approved the thing we asked about". Deleted ⇒ the
  approval is not traced; no behaviour changes.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:285` (`_ask_mark_set`)
- **Read/removed by:** `charter/hooks.py:314` (`_ask_mark_take`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** every component is stripped of chars outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`
  (`charter/hooks.py:275`). `_ask_mark_take` unlinks only on approval, and a declined ask
  **deliberately** leaves its marker: that asymmetry is what makes "asked N, approved M"
  countable (`charter/workspace.py:875`-`:879`, #290). The leftovers are swept with the rest
  of `sessions/` after 30 days by `workspace._prune` (`charter/workspace.py:881`), which runs
  on `set_active` — so a plane nobody switches workspaces in accumulates them (80 were on the
  plane this was written against).

### `sessions/<sid>.route-pending`
- **Format:** plain text, comma-separated persona names + `\n`
- **Status:** **internal**, Python only — set by one hook event and taken by the next in the
  same process family. Deleted ⇒ the routing suggestion is forgotten. purlis neither
  writes nor reads it: `routing:` is retired (charter#369).
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:8366` (`_route_mark_set`)
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:8377` (`_route_mark_take`), cleared `charter/hooks.py:8388`
- **Git:** gitignored

### `sessions/<sid>.persona`
- **Format:** plain text, persona name + `\n` (personas area — listed because it lives here)
- **Status:** **stable** — written by `purlis persona use`, read by the guard, the status
  line and the frame.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/persona.py:1528` (`set_active`)
- **Read by:** `charter/persona.py:1238` (`for_session`), `charter/persona.py:1219`
- **Git:** gitignored

*Reaping:* when a frame chat is reaped, every `sessions/<chat>.*` marker is removed
(`charter/frame/state.py:3377` (`_forget_session`, `charter/frame/state.py:3328`)).

---

### `terminals/` — per-pane pointers

**Tier:** Clone state, transient

*Collected (purlis):* each time `purlis workspace use` writes a pointer, every pointer here last
written 30 days or more before is removed, by its age alone: no reopen record names a pane
(`retention::on_select`, #1025). Opening the plane in the app leaves them alone.

### `terminals/<tid>.workspace`, `terminals/<tid>.persona`
- **Format:** plain text, one name + `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — survives closing/reopening the harness in the same pane and is
  read by every later process in that pane.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:819` (`set_active`), `charter/persona.py:1528`
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:192` + `charter/workspace.py:674`,
  `charter/persona.py:1196`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** filename is the sanitised terminal id (see conventions). Pruned with
  `sessions/` after 30 days (`charter/workspace.py:882`).

---

### `frame/` — the tmux frame's own state (chats, panels, reopen)

**Tier:** Clone state, legacy — the tmux frame's; purlis neither reads nor writes it, so a backup does not carry it.

`frame/` root: `charter/frame/state.py:229`. Two name shapes appear inside it:
a **chat id** `<workspace-prefix>.<n>` (`charter/frame/state.py:316`, prefix rule
`charter/frame/state.py:104`: every char outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` → `_`) and the legacy
**frame id** `<prefix>-<pid>` (`charter/frame/state.py:121`). Both are held to
`[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` (`charter/frame/chats.py:69`).

> **Ruling: `frame/` belongs to the tmux frame, and the app stays out of it.**
> `docs/control-plane.md:872` says these files may change shape in any release and carry no
> format version, and that stands. The app does not draw the tmux frame — it replaces it
> (spec decision 3, milestone M1) — so it keeps its own window state and neither reads nor
> writes anything under `.charter/frame/`. The entries below are recorded because a plane
> the app is working on may have a tmux frame running on it, and because "who owns this
> file" is part of the format. They are marked by what they are to *purlis*: a file two
> purlis processes share is stable to them. If the app ever needs one of these, it is
> promoted to stable here first, and purlis stops calling it scratch at the same time.

### `frame/chat-ids.json`
- **Format:** JSON object `{"<prefix>": <highest ordinal used>}`, `sort_keys=True`, trailing `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — the high-water mark that stops a reused chat id; read and raised
  by every process that mints a chat.
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/frame/state.py:383` (`_raise_mark`, `replace_for`, under the lock)
- **Read by:** `charter/frame/state.py:363` (`_read_mark`), `highest_ordinal`
  (`charter/frame/state.py:463`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** `json.dumps(marks, sort_keys=True) + "\n"`, atomic; the mark is only ever
  raised (`max`), never lowered. Allocation also scans directory names, `reopen.json` and
  `sessions/` markers (`charter/frame/state.py:430`, `:437`, `:449`).

### `frame/chat-ids.lock`
- **Format:** empty file used with `flock(LOCK_EX)`
- **Status:** **stable** — the cross-process mutex for id allocation; the app must take the
  same lock to mint an id.
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy
- **Written by / locked by:** `charter/frame/state.py:349` (`_locked`, opened `"a"`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Deleted?** recreated on demand, but deleting it while another process holds it defeats
  the mutual exclusion.

### `frame/<chat>/` — one directory per chat

**Tier:** Clone state, legacy

Claimed with `claim_private_dir` (`charter/frame/state.py:318`) so a claim is a race-free
`mkdir`. Every file below is one value; unless said otherwise the writer is
`config.replace_for` (atomic) and the reader is `.read_text().strip()`.

| File | Format | Written by | Read by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `launcher` | pid + `\n` | `charter/frame/state.py:556` (`_record_claim`) | `charter/frame/state.py:3223` (`_claiming_pid`), `chats.is_chat` | stable — distinguishes a launching chat from a live one |

| `notice` | `<expiry epoch float>\n<text>\n` | `charter/frame/state.py:738` (`say`) | `charter/frame/state.py:769`, `:803` | stable — one process writes, the panels render it; TTL 4.0s (`charter/frame/state.py:675`), refusals 10.0s (`:683`) |

### `app/` — the desktop app's own state

**Tier:** Clone state — every file below, unless its entry says otherwise.

`.charter/app/` is the **purlis** rebuild's, the way `.charter/frame/` is the tmux
frame's. Python charter neither reads nor writes anything under it, and the app stays out
of `frame/` in the same way — the app replaces that frame rather than sharing its state
(ADR 0025, and the note at the top of this file).

It is recorded here because this file records every file purlis's implementations put in a
plane, and because the two share a plane during the migration: an operator running both
will see this directory, and whoever next changes the app should find its format written
down rather than read off the code.

### `app/sandbox.json`
- **What:** this machine's answer to the one-time offer of the sandbox, and its count of the
  new chats in this project that started with the sandbox and without it — the opt-out rate
  SD-2's outcome bar is measured by (V12). **Local only, never sent** (ruling V78 d): `purlis
  doctor`'s `sandbox` row and the Settings tab show it, and nothing else reads it.
- **Format:** JSON, pretty-printed, trailing `\n`, read and replaced whole under purlis's lock
  on the directory (`rewrite::update`). A file that is not this shape reads as empty, and the
  next count starts it again.
- **Keys:** `offer` — `"taken"` or `"kept-off"` once a person answered the offer, absent
  before; `chats` — `{"sandboxed": n, "opted_out": n, "no_backend": n}`, each new chat counted
  once as it starts (a relaunch is not a new chat). The rate is `opted_out` of `sandboxed +
  opted_out`, rounded up; a chat on a system with no backend was never a choice and is not in
  it; `hosts_seen` — the project's `[sandbox].hosts` as this machine last told the person of
  them (#1341), each spelled as the sandbox writes it, absent before the first: the window's
  one-time Notice names what was added and taken away since, and "Got it" records the list it
  showed. A change made in this machine's own Settings is recorded as seen as it is written;
  `presets_seen` — the project's Internet access presets in force (`[sandbox].egress`, each by
  its word, less any an administrator's policy turns off) and `certificate-checks` where it is
  on, as this machine last told the person of them (#1385), absent before the first, which
  reads as the defaults a project starts with (every preset an administrator's policy allows, certificate checks off): the
  window's one-time Notice names what was turned on and off since, and what each one turned on
  widens past its hosts (the package caches, the certificate check), and "Got it" records the
  set it showed. A change saved in this machine's own Settings is recorded as seen as it is
  written;
  `hosts_mine` — your own `charter.local.toml` hosts you added or confirmed in Settings on this
  machine (#1341), the only ones of that file that grant anything; `writes_mine` — the
  folders you let every chat of this project write on this machine from a block's Notice
  (#1342), each as the kernel names it, judged again at every start and dropped once it no
  longer passes or no longer resolves to itself; `vaults_mine` — the vaults you let a
  persona's chats use in this project on this machine although the vault registry does not tag
  them for that persona (`[{"vault", "persona"}]`, #1430), from a refused vault's Notice: read by
  the app at every brokered `secret exec`, so an Allow or a Revoke needs no restart, and never
  written into `vaults.json`; `granted` — each grant made on this
  machine that lasts past one chat (`{"what": "host"|"write"|"vault"|"dispatch"|"persona-hosts", "target", "level": "you"|"project", "at", "chat"?}`; a vault's `target` is `<vault> for <persona>`), what
  Settings › Sandbox › Granted says of who granted it and when (#1348); `grantable` — the
  folders you listed in Settings › Sandbox as ones chats may be granted (D-1342-10), each whole,
  added to the allowlist a write grant must be inside, each as the kernel named it when listed,
  compared as that spelling, and taken off once it resolves elsewhere (Settings says so);
  `dispatch_mine` — the dispatch grants you made for every chat of this project on this machine
  (#1437), each `{"asking": persona, "target": persona}`: chats running as `asking` may dispatch
  to `target` with no prompt. The only place a dispatch grant of yours is kept; an entry that
  does not name two different personas grants nothing. A grant made here is also listed in
  `granted` with `"what": "dispatch"` and `"target": "<asking> -> <target>"`;
  `persona_hosts_mine` — each persona whose `[sandbox.personas.<persona>].hosts` you allowed
  in this project on this machine (#1362, D-1362-7), `[{"persona", "digest", "changed"?}]`, the
  digest the SHA-256 of what the Notice showed (the line `purlis persona hosts 2`, a line saying
  whether the persona is the default, then each host spelled as the sandbox writes it, sorted,
  one per line): a persona's hosts reach a chat here only while that digest is the one kept.
  `changed: true` marks one seen not to match since, which grants nothing from then on. A grant made here is also listed in
  `granted` with `"what": "persona-hosts"` and `"target": "<persona>"`;
  `dispatch_seen` — the project's `[dispatch.grants]` pairs someone at this machine allowed,
  each as `<asking> -> <target>`, absent before the first. **Only a pair in both the committed
  file and this list is in force here.** Accept on the Notice that says a grant arrived, Accept
  in Settings, and Allow for everyone on a chat's tab each add to it. A pair revoked in this
  machine's own window is taken off it, and so is a pair a commit took out of the project's
  file, or every pair where the project's history cannot be read (`dispatch_seen_at`, #1506).
  **A pair the file on disk does not hold is not in force and stays on this list**: a branch
  switched away and back takes nothing off, and neither does a file that is missing or does
  not parse. Each acceptance is added in one write that checks the file holds the grant;
  `dispatch_any` — the personas whose chats you let dispatch to **any** persona on this machine
  (#1503), each a persona's name, written only from Settings. A name that is not a persona's
  grants nothing, `"*"` included, and so does a `"*"` written as a `target` in `dispatch_mine`;
  `dispatch_any_seen` — the personas whose `"*"` in the project's `[dispatch.grants]` you
  allowed on this machine in Settings (#1503). **Only a persona both there and here is in force
  here**; a name here that the file does not grant `"*"` to grants nothing, and is taken off
  as a pair of `dispatch_seen` is: when a commit took the `"*"` out, or the history cannot be
  read;
  `dispatch_seen_at` — **what the acceptances and the declines are bound to** (#1506): the
  full id of the commit of the project's git history through which this machine has checked
  that no commit took any of them out. Written when a grant is accepted or declined and each
  time the check runs at another commit; absent where nothing is accepted or declined, or the
  project is in no git repository. **The check** runs before a dispatch is decided, when the
  window reads what waits, and after the app's watcher says the project's file moved. It reads
  the history from this commit to the one checked out: every commit that changed the
  project's file under any of its names, on every line that was merged in, with objects read
  as they were written (no replace refs). **An accepted grant is taken off where some commit
  lacks it and a parent of that commit holds it**, though the file reads now as it did; a
  declined one is forgotten the same way, so a grant put back is told again. A branch that
  never held a grant took nothing out, so merging one that predates the grant takes nothing
  off. **Every accepted grant is taken off where that history cannot be read**: this commit is
  no longer in the repository or shares no history with the one checked out; more than 2000
  commits changed the file; an object is missing, or a version of the file is over 1 MiB; the
  repository has a grafts file, or is shallow and this commit is not an ancestor of the one
  checked out; the repository is no longer one; this value is not a commit id; or git did not
  finish within the one deadline the whole check has (30 seconds). **Where git cannot be run,
  the commit checked out cannot be read, or this file cannot be written, nothing here changes
  and no accepted project grant is in force** until a check answers; nothing can be accepted
  meanwhile. It only ever takes acceptances away. **What it does not see:** a grant taken out
  and put back in the working file with no commit; and a history rewritten so that no commit
  here took the grant out (a force-push to a line that never lost it). A project in no git
  repository has no history: its acceptances stand while the file holds the grant.
  **Upgrade and downgrade:** a `dispatch_seen` an earlier build kept has no commit beside it,
  and is bound at the first check to the commit checked out then, with nothing asked again;
  an acceptance that was already stale before the upgrade is kept. An older build that
  rewrites this file drops `dispatch_seen_at` and `dispatch_gone` and keeps `dispatch_seen`,
  so the next check by this build binds afresh: one unbound window per downgrade;
  `dispatch_gone` — the project's grants whose acceptance the check above took off (#1506),
  each `{"said": "<asking> -> <target>" or "<asking> -> *", "why": "removed" or "unread"}`:
  a commit took it out, or the history could not be read (any other word is read as the
  second). One a commit took out that the file does not hold is said once by the window as
  taken away, asking nothing, and that takes it off this list. One the file holds waits for a
  new yes and is said to have been accepted before, with the reason. Accepting or declining
  it takes it off. 
  `dispatch_known` — what this machine knows of each persona a dispatch grant names (#1504;
  ADR 0090 as amended), each `{"name": persona, "hash": hex, "away": bool}`. `hash` is the
  SHA-256 of the persona's definition file as it was when a dispatch was last judged with the
  persona there; absent where none was, or where purlis itself removed the persona. `away` is
  **the absence mark**: the name was seen to be no persona of the project. **A grant is in
  force only while both its personas exist**, checked where a dispatch is judged, and nothing
  is moved while one is away. The mark is written when a judged dispatch or a read of Settings
  › Project › Dispatch finds a granted name that is no persona, and by `purlis persona remove`
  (which also drops `hash`). **It is the only thing a read of Settings writes.** When a marked
  name is a persona again and its definition hashes to `hash`, the mark is lifted and nothing
  else happens. When it is a persona again otherwise, the next judged dispatch sets its grants
  aside (below) and lifts the mark. **The limit:** a persona removed and another made under
  its name with no dispatch judged and no read of Settings in between is never marked, and the
  new persona has the old one's grants; an older build that drops this key loses the marks
  the same way. Closing that needs an identity recorded in the persona's definition, which
  purlis does not have. purlis has no persona rename: a moved folder is a persona gone and
  another appeared;
  `dispatch_dormant` — your grants **set aside** because a name in them came to be another
  persona's (#1504), each `{"asking": name, "target": name, "was": name}`, with `"any": true`
  and `"target": "*"` for one that was "any persona"; `was` is the name that changed hands.
  **Nothing here is in force for any chat.** An entry is moved here, out of `dispatch_mine` or
  `dispatch_any`, when a dispatch is judged and a marked name is a persona again with another
  definition, and before `purlis persona create` makes a persona under a name grants hold
  (which refuses to create it where this write fails). What `granted` says of the grant (when,
  and from which chat) stays. **Give back** in Settings returns everything set aside for one
  name with one press, where the other persona of each exists; **Remove** takes out the one
  entry pressed. "Any persona" is said by `any` alone: a `"*"` someone wrote as the target of a
  named grant is set aside as a pair nobody can be given. The app records each grant it sets
  aside in the event log as a `trust.dispatch.revoke` whose actor is the host; `purlis persona
  create` run from a terminal cannot write the log, and records nothing;
  `dispatch_accepted_aside` — what this machine had accepted of the project's grants for a
  name whose grants were set aside (#1504), each `{"said": "<asking> -> <target>" or "<asking>
  -> *", "was": name}`: taken out of `dispatch_seen` and `dispatch_any_seen` in the same write,
  so the project's grant waits for a yes again, and put back by Give back where the project's
  file still holds the grant;
  `dispatch_declined` — the project's grants you said **Not on my machine** to (#1504), each as
  `<asking> -> <target>`, or `<asking> -> *` for "any persona". Saying it takes the grant out of
  `dispatch_seen` or `dispatch_any_seen`, which is what stops it being in force here; this list
  only keeps it from being told as arrived again. **Accept** in Settings takes it off, and so
  does a commit taking the grant out of the project's file (#1506, `dispatch_seen_at`): a
  grant the project puts back later is a new one, told again. A file on disk that merely
  lacks the grant takes nothing off. Losing this list widens nothing: the grant is then waiting, as a
  teammate's new one is;
  `dispatch_mine_in` — the dispatch grants you made that hold **in one workspace only** (#1505;
  ADR 0090 as amended), each `{"asking": persona, "target": persona or "*", "any"?: true,
  "workspace": name, "seen": n}`: chats running as `asking` may dispatch to `target` for a task
  that works in `workspace`, and for no other. `any` is set, and `target` is `"*"`, for "any
  persona" limited to the workspace; an entry where the two disagree, or whose names are no
  persona's or no workspace's, grants nothing. **A key of its own, and nothing limited is ever
  written to `dispatch_mine` or `dispatch_any`**: a build that does not know the condition
  reads those two as holding everywhere, and does not read this key (and drops it when it
  rewrites the file, which loses the grant and widens nothing). Written by **Allow for me on
  this machine** on a question about a task that works in a workspace, and by a change of a
  grant's workspace in Settings, which moves the grant between this key and the other two in
  one write. Listed in `granted` with `"target": "<asking> -> <target> in <workspace>"`;
  `dispatch_seen_in` — the project's limited grants (`{ to, in }` in `[dispatch.grants]`) that
  someone at this machine allowed, in the same shape. **Only a limited grant both in the
  committed file and here is in force here**; one here that the file no longer holds is taken
  off the next time the grants are read against a project file that was read and parsed;
  `dispatch_workspaces` — what this machine has seen of each workspace a limited grant names,
  each `{"name": workspace, "gone": n, "away"?: true}`: `gone` counts the times the name was
  seen to be no workspace of the project (a folder of exactly that name under `workspaces/`,
  reached through no link), by a judged dispatch, a read of Settings, or purlis's own
  workspace commands (`workspace remove` and `workspace rename` as they finish, and whatever
  makes a workspace folder before it makes one), and `away` says it was gone when last looked
  at. **A limited grant counts only while its workspace is there and its
  `seen` equals that `gone`**, so a workspace made under the name of one that was removed
  inherits no grant: Settings shows the grant as covering nothing, with **Remove**, and
  **Count it again** is the person's yes for the workspace of that name that is there now.
  Nothing is moved by a read; the count is the one thing a read writes. **A grant does not
  follow `purlis workspace rename`**: the grants limited to the old name cover nothing, under
  the new name and under the old one if a workspace is made as it later, until the person
  sets each one's workspace again in Settings; the rename says how many it left, and the
  project's file is not rewritten, since it names the workspace for teammates too. **No grant
  is kept for a name that is no workspace**: an Allow on a question about a task whose
  workspace is not there yet (a handoff that makes it) starts that one dispatch and keeps
  nothing, Accept and a change of workspace refuse such a name, and the next dispatch asks.
  **What this does not catch:** a workspace's folder removed and made again by hand, or by a
  pull, with no dispatch judged and Settings not read in between is not seen gone, and the
  new one has the old one's grants; a workspace has no identity beside its name. A grant limited to a workspace that names a persona whose name
  changed hands is ended, not set aside (`dispatch_dormant` keeps no workspace). **A file
  that does not read as this shape grants nothing at all**: every dispatch to another persona
  asks again, and one from a chat nobody is at is refused. **No never is kept here**: nevers
  are `app/dispatch-never.json`'s, so this file's faults and an older build's rewrite of it
  cost none. One dev build kept them here as `dispatch_never`; that key is carried as written
  through every write of this file and moved to `app/dispatch-never.json` the first time the
  nevers are read.
- **Who writes it:** the app, at each new chat's start, at the offer's answer, when the
  hosts Notice or the presets Notice is read, when the Notice of a project's dispatch grants is answered or its
  "taken away" is read, when the check of `dispatch_seen_at` takes an acceptance off or moves
  to another commit (reading the grants in force or Settings' table writes nothing), and
  at a persona's hosts' Allow (#1362), and at a grant's Allow or Revoke (`sandbox::local`). A sandboxed chat cannot: `.charter/app/` is the integrity class's.
- **Tier:** Clone state — deleting it asks the offer again, if the project still has the
  sandbox off, and starts the count from nothing (ADR 0069).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).

### `app/dispatch-never.json`
- **What:** the pairs of personas you said **never** to on this machine (#1503; ADR 0090 as
  amended 2026-10-08): while one stands, no chat running as `asking` is asked or allowed to
  dispatch to `target`. It beats a dispatch grant at every level, the project's
  `[dispatch.grants]` and "any persona" included; only an administrator's policy lock is said
  before it. **It holds down a chain of chats**: a chat with a chat running as `asking`
  anywhere above it in its lineage is refused `target` too, whatever its own persona is
  granted, so work that persona asked for does not arrive through a third. The person's own
  dispatch from a chat's tab is not held to it. Written by the grant Notice's **Never for this
  pair** and taken out by **Lift** in Settings › Project › Dispatch; each is recorded in the
  event log first (`trust.dispatch.never`, `trust.dispatch.never.lift`). **A never is not set
  aside when its persona goes** (#1504): it holds for whichever persona has the name. Nothing in the
  committed project file says never or lifts one.
- **Why a file of its own:** it is the one record of dispatch that denies. Every other is an
  allow, kept in `app/sandbox.json`, where "does not read" is read as empty and lets nothing
  through. Kept apart, no fault in that file unreads a never, and no build from before this
  file rewrites it.
- **Format:** JSON, pretty-printed, trailing `\n`, read and replaced whole under purlis's lock
  on the directory (`rewrite::update`). **A file that is there and does not read as the shape
  below is never read as "no nevers"**: while it stands, no dispatch grant covers any pair of
  two personas, one made for a single chat included. The person is asked on the asking chat's
  tab, the Notice says the list could not be read, and an Allow starts that one dispatch; a
  chat nobody is at is refused. A link, a folder or a file that cannot be read is the same. **A
  write never replaces what it could not read**: Never for this pair and Lift are refused with
  a sentence, and the bytes stay as they are. Mending it is the person's: fix the file, or
  delete it, which says never to nothing. No file is no nevers.
- **Keys:** `never` — a list of `{"asking": persona, "target": persona}`. Each is matched
  exactly as it is spelled and is never dropped for its spelling: one whose names are no
  persona's refuses nothing real, and a `"*"` in one is not a pattern. An entry that is not two
  strings makes the whole file unread, since what it meant to refuse is unknown. Any other key,
  at the top or in an entry, is kept as it is written. **An entry may also say when, and on
  which chat's question** (#1464): `at`, seconds since 1970, and `chat`, the asking chat's name
  as its tab showed it (none for a never said on a needs-you item). Settings' table says both,
  as the Granted list says of a grant. Neither is part of the never: an entry without them,
  or with an `at` that is not a number or a `chat` that is not a string, refuses the same, and
  a never said again keeps when it was first said.
- **Not kept here:** **Keep blocked**, the Notice's other no, is the app's memory and no file's.
  It is held per chat and per pair, so that chat asking again is refused at once and not asked
  twice, and is gone when the chat closes or purlis quits; a new chat is asked. **It is not
  per workspace** (#1505): kept blocked for a persona on a question about one workspace, that
  chat is refused that persona for a task in any other workspace too. A no is not limited,
  as a never is not.
- **Who writes it:** the app, on the person's press (`purlis_core::dispatchnever`). A
  sandboxed chat cannot: `.purlis/app/` is the integrity class's. A chat that runs without the
  sandbox runs as the person and can.
- **Tier:** Clone state — deleting it lifts every never said on this machine for this project
  (ADR 0069).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.purlis/`).

### `app/sandbox-blocks.json`
- **No longer written** (#1662). It held seven days of sandbox blocks for `purlis doctor`'s
  count; those are kept now in this machine's network record in purlis's data home
  (`<data>/network/<project key>.jsonl`, in the machine-tier table below), and nothing reads
  this file. One left behind is gitignored, under the state folder, and the app removes it
  when it opens the project, once it is ten minutes old, and logs that it did (#1681).
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy — deleting it changes nothing (ADR 0069).

### `app/reopen.json`
- **Format:** JSON, `indent=2`, trailing `\n`. Replaced whole by `rewrite::replace`: written
  to a temp file beside it (`.charter-generated.reopen.json.<pid>.<tag>.tmp`), flushed and
  renamed over, so a launch never reads half of one. Mode 0600. A `reopen.json` that is a
  symlink is refused (#434).
- **Status:** **internal** — written and read by the app alone. Deleting it costs one
  relaunch's worth of chats: the app starts with none open, which is what a first launch
  does anyway. No second process reads it, which is what would make it stable.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the reopen record V2 names (ADR 0069). Deleting it costs the chats'
  restore. It stays Clone state with `clone` in it: the key says which clone the record
  belongs to, and a copy that carries it is told apart, not trusted.
- **Written by:** `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (purlis) — whenever what is open changes
  (a chat started, closed, brought to front, dragged to another place on its strip, or moved
  onto another conversation by its own harness), and again on the way out. Not only on the
  way out: an app that is killed, or crashes, runs no exit handler. **Restart to update**
  (purlis#251) writes it too, with `relaunch_after_update`, before the restart is asked
  for, so a relaunch that fails loses nothing: the next launch reads the same record.
- **Read by:** `app/src-tauri/src/planes.rs`, at a launch, twice: once for the counts the
  launch's question names (how many chats and view tabs, in which projects), and once when the
  operator has answered it and the record is put back (purlis#250). **Nothing it names
  starts before that answer.** "Start fresh" rewrites it holding no chat and no view tab, and
  keeps `dealt`; Esc, closing the question, or a window that never answers all mean "Reopen
  all", and the file is left as it was until then. Also by `purlis_core::reopen::conversation_of`,
  which answers the conversation one chat is in by its `number` — how a chat asks which
  conversation it is, keyed by the `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID` the app gave it, and
  `purlis_core::reopen::identity_of`, which answers its id and current run the same way. Those
  readers ship in the same build as the writer, so the file stays internal. Each of `id`,
  `device`, `run` and `resumed_from` is held to a ULID on the way in, and anything else reads as
  absent. **A launch also reads other clones' `reopen.json`**: the root its `clone` names and the
  projects the machine store remembers, when the record's clone-key is not this clone's, to tell
  a copied project from a moved one (V43, below). It compares chat ids, through the same guarded
  read, and runs nothing it reads there.
- **Git:** gitignored already, by the plane's own `/.charter/` line.
- **No lock** — one app per plane (Tauri's single-instance plugin), and last writer wins.

| Field | Type | Required / default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `version` | int | `1`; any other value and the record is ignored whole | format version |
| `at` | int epoch | required | when it was written; nothing reads it |
| `chats[]` | list | required | one entry per chat that was open, **in the order the chat strip drew them**, which is the order a launch puts them back in (ADR 0039, amended for SI-6: the operator can drag a tab). A record written before that lists them in the order they were numbered, which was the strip's order then, so it reads back as the strip its operator last saw |
| `chats[].program` | str | required | the program, as it was launched: a path or a bare name |
| `chats[].args` | list[str] | default `[]` | its arguments, **without** any purlis added — a resume spells those differently from a start, so they are decided again at the reopen |
| `chats[].cwd` | str | default `""` (absent) | the directory it ran in |
| `chats[].name` | str | default `""` | what the operator calls the chat; a harness that takes a name is given it again |
| `chats[].resume` | str | default `""` | the harness session id the chat is in **now**, and so the one a relaunch resumes (Q10): the id purlis chose at the start (Claude Code), then whatever the chat's own harness moved it onto as its hook reported it — the first id a Codex or opencode chat names, the new one a Claude Code chat is in after `/clear`. Written the moment the app's board adopts or follows the report; a report the board refuses (a harness nested in the chat's shell, ADR 0024 C5) never reaches it. Empty for a chat whose harness has not named a conversation yet, and for a shell. Held to `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,127}` — the Python charter's `SESSION_ID_RE` (`charter/frame/state.py:1128`) — on the way in, and a value that is not one reads as empty. It reaches a command line, and one starting with `-` would be a flag the operator never typed. The chat still comes back, as a new one |
| `chats[].active` | bool | default `false` | whether it was the chat in front |
| `chats[].profile` | str | default `""` (absent) | the harness profile the chat started on, by NAME — never its command or its environment, so an edit to `charter.local.toml` takes effect at the reopen and the account it names never reaches this file (ADR 0022). Held to a name purlis would mint; anything else reads as empty |
| `chats[].persona` | str | default `""` (absent) | the persona the chat adopted, under the same rule |
| `chats[].footer` | str | default `""` | `"show"` where this chat draws purlis's footer in its pane, empty otherwise ([ADR 0029](adr/0029-the-pane-footer-is-blanked-by-default-and-a-chat-may-keep-it.md)). The same word the chat's `$CHARTER_FOOTER` carries, so the record and the launch cannot mean different things by it. **Any other value reads as empty** — a record written before this key existed, and one somebody else wrote, both come back blanked, which is what the app did before the setting existed |
| `chats[].label` | str | default `""` (absent) | the name the operator gave the chat (purlis#254), which its tab says instead of the default `<persona> <N>`. purlis's label only: `name` is still what the harness was started with and is resumed under. Written only when one was given, so a plane that never renamed a chat writes the record it always wrote. Held on the way in to the rule a rename is: trimmed, at most 64 characters, and no control or invisible formatting character (`purlis_core::panel::undrawable`); a value that breaks it reads as absent and the chat comes back under its default |
| `chats[].from` | object | absent | the chat a dispatch opened this one from, a handoff or a task (purlis#258, #259, #1436): `{"chat": <n>, "name": "<str>", "workspace": "<str>", "report": "owed" \| "sent" \| "failed", "mode": "task", "depth": <n>, "root": "<ULID>", "above": ["<persona>", ""], "by": "person"}`. `chat` is the app's number for that chat, the key its reports are left under; `name` is the name it was shown under when it handed off (a copy, so the note still reads once it has closed); `workspace` is where it handed off from, where a report goes once it is gone — a workspace's name, or `plane root` for a chat that handed off from the plane root (SI-1b); `report` is absent for a handoff, which owes none, `"owed"` for a task whose report has not been sent (and for a `--report` handoff an older purlis opened, which is read as a task, below), and `"sent"` after it, for good: a task gets one report. A handed-off chat the person stops may send one report in its last turn (#1448), by `purlis dispatch report` (#1471), and its record then says `"sent"`. For a task, `"failed"` says the app reported in the chat's place (#1443): its program ended before it reported, or the person closed or stopped it, and the chat that asked was told so. It is final, as `"sent"` is: a chat started again in that tab cannot report for the task. Written only for a handed-off chat, so a plane that never handed off writes the record it always wrote. Held on the way in: a `chat` of `0`, a `name` the label rule refuses or a `workspace` that is neither a workspace's name nor `plane root` reads as the whole key absent — the note is not drawn and no report is owed. `mode` is `"task"` for a chat a dispatch started as a task, which owes one report, is listed under the chat that asked and whose report says how it ended; it is absent for a handoff, which is every record written before the key, and any other value reads as a handoff. **An older record is read as what it now is** (#1519): a purlis from before #1515 started a chat that needed an answer as a handoff with `--report`, so its record has no `mode` and `report` `"owed"`. This purlis opens no such chat: a request on the hook socket that asks for a report opens nothing, records nothing and is refused, naming `purlis dispatch` (#1471). Such a chat, still open after an update, is read as the task of the chat that asked: `mode` `"task"`, `depth` at least `1`, and `tab_opened` `true` where its `from` reads, so it has the tab it was opened with. Its report then wakes the chat that asked, that chat lists it and may wait on it, and an end without a report is reported for, as for any task; and, as any task, purlis ends it once it has reported (it can be reopened from its finished row). Its report goes only to the chat `chat` names, and it holds the grants it held. **The chat that asked gains a task owner's powers over it**, which it had over no handoff: it may tell it, cancel it, answer its questions and wait on it. No other chat may. It reports with `purlis dispatch report`, and the older command it was taught is answered with that one. The next write of the record writes the newer shape. A handoff with no `report`, or one whose report is `"sent"`, is the handoff it was. `depth` is how many dispatches stand between this chat and the chat the person started, `1` for a chat that one dispatched, written when the chat is started so that closing a chat above it never makes a chain look shallower; it is absent for `0`, which is a record written before the key; a chat's depth is read as at least the number of chats the walk finds above it (#1548), and a value above 8, the deepest a chain can be, reads as 8. `root` is the lineage the chat is in, by the id (`chats[].id`) of the chat the person started: copied down each dispatch, a handoff's too, so every chat of one lineage names the same root whichever chats between them have closed, and a chat started again under a new number is still in it. The dispatch limit on a lineage counts by it (#1436). It is absent for a record written before the key and for a lineage whose first chat had no id, and such a chat is counted by who dispatched whom, as before; a value that is not a ULID reads as absent. It says which lineage and nothing else: `chat` is where the report goes, and neither says who may steer the chat. `above` is the personas of the chats above this one, nearest first, `""` for a chat on no persona (#1521): the asking chat's own, then the `above` its record keeps, written by the app when it starts the chat, from its record of the asking chat and never from anything a chat sent, a handoff's too. **The loop rule and the person's never for a chat above read it**, so a chain still holds where a chat in the middle has closed, finished or been cleared. It holds one name per dispatch above, as many as `depth` says. A finished task reopened as an ordinary chat names no `from`, so nothing is above it and what it dispatches starts a new chain. It is absent for a record written before the key: such a chat's chain is read from the chats still open, as before, and where that walk meets a chat that has closed (or a loop), purlis reads the chain from its own dispatch records (`<state>/app/dispatches/`), and only where they show it whole, up to the chat `root` names and as deep as `depth` says (#1548); otherwise it cannot say who was above, and **refuses any dispatch to another persona** from it, and one to its own where the person said never to any persona dispatching there, saying that the chat's chain began under an older version, which kept no record of it. One whose length is not `depth`, or that names what cannot be a persona's name, reads as absent, never as a shorter chain. When the chat `chat` names is started again under a new number (a restart for a grant, Restart now, Start fresh), the app rewrites `chat` to the new number. `by` is `"person"` for a task the person started from that chat's tab with **Ask <persona>…** (#1438), and absent otherwise; any other value reads as absent. **It is wording only**: it decides what the new chat's first line and its report say about who asked, and nothing reads it to allow, grant or start anything |
| `chats[].reopened` | str | default `""` (absent) | `"task"` for a finished task the person reopened as an ordinary chat (ADR 0090 item 16, #1543), `"person"` for one they had asked for with **Ask <persona>…**, and absent for every other chat. Written by the app when it reopens the task, from the task's own record, and never from anything a chat sent. A reopened task names no `from`, so it owes no report and nothing above it reads it, but it still runs on the profile a dispatch chose: **each later start of it, a relaunch or a restart, is held to what that dispatch was held to**, a profile the project lists for its persona under `[dispatch.profiles]` and one whose command does not switch the harness's permission prompts off, as the Reopen itself was. **Any other value reads as `"task"`**, so a word somebody else wrote never lets the chat out of that check; `"person"` changes only the words of a refusal, as `from.by` does. Not a format change, for `pinned`'s reason |
| `chats[].tab_opened` | bool | default `false` (absent) | whether the person opened this task chat's tab (#1447). Read only for a chat a dispatch started as a task, which is listed with no tab until its row asks for one; every other chat has a tab from its start. Written by the window's `open_chat_tab`, and taken back by `close_chat_tab` when the person sends the tab back to the Chats list (#1488), which ends nothing: the task keeps working. Written only when it changes; absent on every record written before it |
| `chats[].shows` | int | default `0` (absent) | the `number` of the chat this chat's tab shows in place of it (#1486): a task below it, at any depth, that the person switched the tab to. Absent while the tab shows its own chat. Written by the window's `tab_shows`, only when it changes, and re-pointed where a chat is started again under a new number, as `from.chat` is. **It says where the person is looking, and nothing else is decided by it**: the core starts and allows nothing by this number. The chat the tab in front shows is the one the person is taken to be looking at, so a task that has reported is not ended while it is that chat (its end, already due, waits until they switch away), and no system notification is sent about that chat while the window has the keyboard. A launch puts the tab back on that chat only where it is open and is a task below this one, and on the session's own chat otherwise; the window then says so, and the key goes. A launch that leaves a finished task out of the put-back takes the key off the tab that showed it. Not a format change, for `pinned`'s reason: its absence reads as what every record without it meant |
| `chats[].beside` | int | default `0` (absent) | the `number` of the chat whose tab this chat has a pane in (#1489), where it is not that tab's own chat: a task the person opened beside the session that asked for it, or any chat started in a split. Absent for a chat that is its tab's own, and for one with no pane. Written by the window's `tab_shows`, only when it changes, and re-pointed where a chat is started again under a new number, as `shows` is. Two things read it: a launch puts a **task** back beside that chat, where it came back with a tab, and leaves it in the Chats list otherwise (every other chat comes back as a tab of its own, as it always has); and every chat beside the chat in front is on screen with it, so a reported task among them is not ended while the person reads it and none is notified about. The core starts and allows nothing by this number. Not a format change, for `pinned`'s reason |
| `chats[].renamed_from` | str | default `""` (absent) | the workspace `purlis workspace rename` moved this chat away from, where the rename left it with no conversation its harness can find (charter#367, D10). Claude Code keeps a conversation under the folder it ran in, so the rename clears such a chat's `resume` and writes this instead; a Codex or opencode chat keeps its `resume`. The next start is a new conversation whose pane says why, and the chat is written without this key from then on. Held to the workspace-name rule on the way in; anything else reads as absent |
| `chats[].number` | int | default `0` (not known) | the chat's display number in this plane (purlis#90): what `$CHARTER_CHAT` and `$CHARTER_SESSION_ID` carry, and what `.charter/sessions/<n>.*` and `handbacks/chat-<n>/` are keyed on. `0` is a record written before the field, whose chats are dealt numbers in order at the next launch. Unique in this plane on this machine only, and so never what a committed file or an event names a chat by ([ADR 0066](adr/0066-a-chat-is-a-ulid-a-run-is-a-stretch-of-its-conversation-and-a-device-is-random.md)) |
| `dealt` | int | default `0` | the highest number this plane has dealt, open or closed, so none is dealt twice. Held at or above every `number` the record names, both ways. "Start fresh" keeps it |
| `chats[].id` | str | default `""` (absent) | the chat's id, a ULID minted by the app once per clone and device (V43), when it first starts the chat in that clone, and never changed there ([ADR 0066](adr/0066-a-chat-is-a-ulid-a-run-is-a-stretch-of-its-conversation-and-a-device-is-random.md), #834). What an event names the chat by, and what a session record, the audit and OTel will. Absent in a record written before it, and then minted at the launch that reads it, as `number` was. A chat put back, or started again in the place of one whose harness could not bring its conversation back (`lostOnResume`), keeps it |
| `chats[].device` | str | default `""` (absent) | the chat's origin device: the device id, from the machine store, of the machine that minted `id`. Never a hostname. Absent where that machine had none (ADR 0031), which reads as `unknown` |
| `chats[].sandbox` | str | default `""` (absent) | `"off"` where the chat's last run started without the sandbox in a project that has it on: a person's opt-out, or a system with no sandbox backend (ADR 0067 §7). A fact about the run that was, **never read as an opt-out**: a relaunch or a resume starts the chat sandboxed — the host then writes `trust.sandbox.on` for it — or refuses it where the sandbox cannot be applied (a Codex chat in a sandboxed project, a program the sandbox will not bind). The chat's session record says `sandbox: off` from it. Any other word reads as absent |
| `chats[].run` | str | default `""` (absent) | the ULID of the chat's current run: the stretch of its conversation it is in now. Every start begins one (`start`, `reopen` or `fresh`), and a `/clear` the board follows begins another; ADR 0066's `wake` and `switch` will too once SC-4 and the switches exist. The event log's `run.started` names the same id |
| `chats[].resumed_from` | str | default `""` (absent) | the id of the chat whose session record **Resume** started this one from, taken from that record's `chat-id`. Absent for every other chat, and, until session records carry `chat-id`, for every chat. `from` (above) is to gain an `id` key the same way: the parent's chat id, next to the `chat` number reports are still left under; that key is **decided, not yet written** |
| `chats[].pid` | int | default `0` (absent) | the process the app started this chat's program as, while it runs (V82, #1018): what `commit-msg` and `purlis save` check that a commit runs below before they stamp provenance trailers. Taken from the running session at every write of the record, so one a record was put back with is replaced at the next write. It may be a wrapper profile's process; the harness runs below it. Written only while the chat's program runs: the record is written again when it ends, and the record written at quit names no pid. `0` reads as absent, and a chat with none stamps nothing |
| `chats[].model` | str | default `""` (absent) | the model the chat's harness said its program runs on, in the `model` of its `SessionStart` hook (ADR 0087 §6, #1021): what a provenance trailer's `Assisted-by: <harness>:<model>` names. Taken only from a report the board took as the chat's own harness (ADR 0024), never from a sub-agent's, and the latest one wins. Of the program that runs now, as `pid` is: a start knows none until its harness says, and the record written at quit names none. A value that is not one word of printable ASCII, at most 88 bytes (so `claude-code:<model>` fits a trailer value's 100), reads as absent, and absent leaves `Assisted-by: <harness>` |
| `clone` | object | absent | the clone and the device that wrote this record (V43, amending [ADR 0066](adr/0066-a-chat-is-a-ulid-a-run-is-a-stretch-of-its-conversation-and-a-device-is-random.md)): `{"key": "<16 hex>", "root": "<path>", "device": "<ULID>"}`. The app stamps it onto every record it writes. Absent in a record written before V43, which adopts the clone it is opened in and keeps its ids. Held on the way in: a `key` that is not 16 lowercase hex characters or a `root` that is not absolute reads as the whole key absent |
| `clone.key` | str | required in `clone` | the clone-key ([ADR 0079](adr/0079-search-runs-on-derived-sqlite-indexes-one-per-project-clone-and-one-per-machine.md) §8): the first 16 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the clone's canonical root path, over the path's bytes. **A launch on another device than `clone.device` reads nothing: the project was copied** (below). **A launch on the same device whose key differs looks for another clone holding these chats**: it reads the `reopen.json` at `root`, then at every project the machine store's recents remember opening (D-V43x), skipping any that is gone or is this very directory (same device and inode, so a firmlink, a bind mount or a hand-edited `root` naming this directory is the same clone). If one holds any of these chats' ids, the project was **copied**, and every chat is given a new `id` and `device` (and no `run`, until it starts) before any starts. Otherwise it was **moved**: the ids are kept and `clone` is rewritten. A copy whose original is unreachable **and** not among the projects this machine remembers reads as a move and keeps its ids, which V43 accepts |
| `clone.root` | str | required in `clone` | the clone's canonical root when it wrote this, because a key cannot be followed back to a directory. Written only as the exact path: a clone whose root is not UTF-8 writes no `clone` at all, and every launch of it reads as a record from before V43 |
| `clone.device` | str | default `""` (absent) | the device id of the machine that wrote this, from the machine store; absent where it had none (ADR 0031). **Another device than this launch's means a copy, whatever the key says**: a same-path copy to another machine has the same key. So new ids are also minted when the project moves to another machine, when the machine store is reset, and when another `CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME` opens it (a dev or isolated build). Unknown on either side, the key decides |
| `relaunch_after_update` | bool | default `false`; written only when `true` | the quit that wrote this restarted purlis to install an update (purlis#251, **Restart to update**, the only writer of `true`), so the launch after it says why it is asking ("Reopen all" is the answer in front either way). Every later write is an ordinary one and drops it. **It counts only at the launch that follows the restart**: the restart also leaves an empty `restarted-to-update` file beside the machine store (`$CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, else `~/.config`, then `charter/`), and the next launch removes it whatever it opens. A plane that launch did not open keeps the flag, and it says nothing at any later launch |
| `views[]` | list | default `[]`; absent when no view tab is open | one entry per tab that held a **view** rather than a chat, so a launch puts the tab back (ADR 0043, as amended for view tabs); at most 64 are put back. Putting one back runs nothing: an extension's view waits for a press. A line that fails any rule below is dropped whole, and the rest kept |
| `views[].from` | str | default `""` | the extension whose view it is; empty for purlis's own. A workspace-name word of at most 64 characters |
| `views[].view` | str | required | which view of theirs, under the same rule as `from` |
| `views[].key` | str | default `""` | what the view is about inside that: empty for the whole project, else one workspace-name word (a persona's name, a vault's). **purlis's own views keyed by a path of names** are the exception, each held to exactly one shape and nothing else (#1297): `piece-files` (a branch's file tab, FM-2) `workspace/repo/piece`, the piece empty (`workspace/repo/`) for the repo's own folder; `piece-file` and `piece-diff` that branch, then the file's relative path, no segment empty, `.` or `..`; `todo` `<workspace>/<slug>`; `memory` `workspace/<ws>/<slug>`, `persona/<name>/<slug>` or `shared/<slug>`, the slug `\` for a memory not written yet; `memory-archive` `workspace/<ws>`, `persona/<name>` or `shared`; `session` a session record's project-relative path, `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/<file>` or `sessions/<file>`. Every name passes the rule its writer mints it by, and no key holds a control character or is longer than 4096 characters. No other view's key may hold a `/` |
| `views[].title` | str | default the view's id | what its tab said: one line, at most 120 characters, else the view's own id |
| `views[].workspace` | str | default `""` | the workspace whose strip it was on; empty, or a name that is not a workspace's, files it outside every workspace |
| `views[].at` | int | default `0` | where it was on the strip, counted over chats and views together from the left: a place, not a promise |
| `views[].active` | bool | default `false` | whether it was the tab in front |
| `views[].pinned` | bool | default `false` | whether the operator pinned it (ADR 0039) |
| `views[].split` | number | absent | where the view's divider was, as its first side's share of the tab in percent: the file tab's tree beside its preview (FM-2). Written only once the divider was moved. **Read only between 1 and 99** (rounded to a whole percent); any other number is forgotten and the tab still comes back. The window holds the tree between 10% and 70% |
| `focus` | object | absent | the branch the window's explorer was focused on, its cockpit (FM-5, #1108): `{"workspace": "<name>", "repo": "<name>", "piece": "<name>"}`, with `piece` empty for the repo's own folder. Kept with `views`, and written only while a branch is focused, so a window that never focused one writes the record it always wrote. Held on the way in: a name purlis would not mint, or a value that is not such an object, reads as absent. Not something a launch asks about: a record holding only a focus puts nothing back to ask about |

Which harness a chat runs is **not** recorded: it is read from `program`'s file name, so a
record cannot disagree with what is about to be started. Only a harness purlis has
measured a resume for is resumed (`crates/purlis-core/src/harness.rs`, which carries the
same values as `charter/harness/`). A Codex or opencode chat has no `resume` until its first
turn, because each reports its id only through a hook, inside that turn (ADR 0024, ADR 0058);
from then on it is recorded, and a relaunch runs `codex resume <id>` or `opencode -s <id>`.

### `app/dispatches/<id>.json` — a dispatch's record
- **What:** one file for each **dispatch**: one chat starting another, as a handoff today and
  as a task once chats dispatch tasks (#1452, spec #1434). It says who asked, which persona it
  went to, in which mode, where it worked, the brief, the report, **the messages the two chats
  sent each other through purlis while it ran** (#1495: each follow-up, progress note,
  question and answer, with its time), when it started and ended, how often it needed the
  person, and what its harness said it cost. The window's Dispatches tab lists them, a session
  record's tab lists the ones its chat asked for, and a chat's Activity tab is read from them.
- **Format:** JSON, pretty-printed, trailing `\n`, mode 0600, replaced whole
  (`rewrite::replace`) under purlis's lock on the directory. `<id>` is a ULID minted when the
  record is opened, and the only names read or written as a record are `<ULID>.json`. A file that is
  not a record of this version is listed by nobody and left as it is.
- **Keys:** `v` — `1`; `id`; `mode` — `"task"` or `"handoff"`; `asker` — the asking chat:
  `chat` (the app's number for it then), `id` (its ULID, absent for a chat given none), `name`
  (as the person saw it), `persona` (absent for none), `workspace` (absent for the project's
  root), `by_person` (whether the person dispatched from that chat's tab themselves),
  `session_record` (the asking chat's session record, once it wrote one after this dispatch,
  by its project-relative path); `persona` — the persona dispatched to, absent for none;
  `worker` — the persona chat: `chat`, `id`, `name`, `persona`, `harness`, `profile`, and
  `session_record` (its own: the newest it wrote, #1513); `task` — the task's name, absent where the
  dispatch gave none; `place` — where it worked: `workspace` (absent for the project's root),
  `folder` (relative to the project, `.` for its root, or absolute for one outside it),
  `worktree` (`{"repo", "piece", "branch"?, "removed"?}`, absent unless the dispatch gave it
  its own; see *Its own worktree* below);
  `brief` — the message the persona chat started on, without its stamp; `report_owed`
  (a running record with `mode` `"handoff"` and `report_owed` `true` is an older purlis's
  handoff that asked for a report; this purlis opens a request that asks for a report as a
  task. When a project opens, before any chat is put back, it is rewritten with `mode`
  `"task"`, so it ends as a task, as its chat is read (#1519): where the reopen record brings
  its chat back, only if that chat's `from` still says `"owed"`, and always where its chat is
  not coming back. One that has ended, and one whose chat says it reported, are left as they
  are);
  `started` and `ended` — UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00`, `ended` absent while it runs;
  `report` — absent while it runs and for a dispatch that ended owing none:
  `{"outcome": "done"|"blocked"|"failed"|"cancelled"|"stopped", "text", "changed": {"said"?,
  "files"?, "commits"?, "branch"?}}`, where `changed.said` is what a task's report says it
  changed, in the persona chat's own words (`purlis dispatch report --changed`), absent where
  the report said nothing of it; `branch` is the branch the app cut for a dispatch that works
  in its own worktree (#1453): the app's own `place.worktree.branch`, written beside `said`
  and never read from the report, and absent for a dispatch given no worktree; `files` and
  `commits` are kept for the same dispatch and not written yet; `cancelled` is a task its asking chat cancelled (#1441),
  recorded so whatever its chat said of its outcome, and `stopped` is a chat the person
  stopped or closed before it reported (#1443, #1448), with the text `stopped by the
  operator`; neither is recorded as `failed`. A purlis from before the two words does not
  read such a record, and lists the others; `needed_you` — how many times the persona chat came to wait on the person;
  `messages` — how many messages passed between the two chats after the brief: each follow-up,
  progress note, question and answer purlis took, counted as it is taken; `talk` — those
  messages, oldest first, as far as the record keeps them (#1495; see *The messages it keeps*
  below), absent for a dispatch nothing was said in, which is every record written before the
  key; `usage` —
  `{"input_tokens"?, "output_tokens"?, "cost_usd"?}`, what the persona chat's harness said the
  session cost (`app/spend/<chat>.json`). **`usage` is absent for a harness that reports none,
  and each part of it is absent where the harness did not say it: never a zero.** It is the
  one figure in the record that is not the app's own: what the chat's harness reported,
  relayed where no sandboxed chat can write (#1457, D-1452-12). Read as the dispatch ends,
  while a reporting turn may still run, and kept again once its chat has gone, where its
  harness said more since: the whole, the reporting turn included. Every text is
  held to a cap as it is written, so a record is never written larger than it is read back:
  a brief to 16 KiB, a report's text and what it says changed to 8 KiB each, a name to 512 bytes, a path to 1 KiB, and a
  report's files and commits to 100 each. A text over its cap is cut at a character and ends
  ` [cut at N bytes]`; a long brief or report never costs the dispatch its record.
- **What is kept for a finished task** (#1485): a task ends at its report. purlis ends its
  program once the report is delivered and the turn that sent it is over, and closes its
  chat; from then the record is all of it there is, and the row under the chat that asked is
  read from it. **Not every report ends the program**: one that came out `blocked` does not
  (the task is waiting on something, and its conversation is what the next step needs), nor
  does the report of a task the person started from a tab (`asker.by_person`: it is their
  conversation, and they close it), nor one that reached no chat because the asking chat had
  gone. Those chats stay open as the chats they are, and are finished rows once they are
  closed. Six more keys, all absent from a record written before them:
  - `conversation` — the conversation the persona chat was in when the dispatch ended: **the
    id that chat's own harness reported**, as the board follows it, and only where the harness
    reported none, the id the app started the chat on. Never a value a line on the hook
    channel names for another chat. Held to a name's cap. Written once the record has ended (with the
    report, or as the chat is closed), and never while it runs. **It is what Reopen resumes**:
    a new chat on the record's `worker.profile`, `persona` and `place.folder`, which names no
    asking chat and so is no task. Absent for a chat whose harness named none, and such a
    task is not offered Reopen. Reopen is refused where `worker.harness` is not the harness
    that profile runs now.
  - `cleared` — `true` once the finished task's row was taken off its asking chat's list: by
    Clear finished, by a Reopen whose new chat was heard from (or lived past a quarter of a
    minute), or because the asking chat closed. Absent until then. A Reopen whose chat ended
    at once clears nothing: the row is drawn again. **It is the row's mark and nothing
    else**: a cleared record keeps its brief, its report and every other key, is still listed
    in the Dispatches tab, and is collected as any record is.
  - `ended_by` — who ended the dispatch, where that was not its chat's own report alone:
    `"unreported"` where the chat went without reporting and purlis said so in its place,
    `"person"` where the person stopped or closed it, whatever it reported in the one turn its
    stop gave it, and `"limit"` where purlis stopped it at its time limit, or with the task
    above it that reached one (#1512), with `ended_way` as for the person's. Written by the
    app in the same write as the ending.
  - `worked` — the seconds the task has worked, as the app's clock counted them (#1512): its
    turn running and no prompt showing; never time waiting on the person or on its own tasks,
    nor time purlis was not running. What `minutes-per-task` is held to, and what a task put
    back after a restart starts from. Absent while it is 0.
  - `limit` — beside `ended_by: "limit"`: `{"kind": "time", "limit": <minutes>, "worked":
    <minutes>}`, or `{"kind": "above", "limit": <minutes>}` for a task stopped with the task
    above it. Written by the app as the stop begins; its finished row names it. **How a row reads is
    decided from this and never from the report's words**, so a task cannot make its row say
    purlis's sentence by reporting it. Absent for a dispatch that ended by its own report.
  - `kept_open` — `true` once the person took the task's chat over after it reported: a key
    of theirs in its pane, or a Smart close of it beginning. purlis does not end such a chat,
    then or at the next launch.
  - `undelivered` — `{"kept"?}`, set where a task's report reached no chat because the chat
    that asked had gone (#1513, V100-64): the report was kept for that chat's workspace, or it
    waited for that chat's next turn and the chat closed first. `kept` names the file it is
    kept in, as `workspace-<ws>/<file>.json` or `plane-root/<file>.json` under
    `<state>/handbacks/`, and nothing else is read as one: absent where it was kept in no file
    (a task that ended at a launch with its asking chat not open). **When the chat that asked
    comes back** (a launch that puts it back, **Retry now** on it, **Resume** from a session
    record that `asker.session_record` or `asker_last_record` names, or **Reopen** on its
    finished row where it was a task itself) the report is taken back from that file before
    the chat starts and left for its next turn once it has. The key stays until then: it is
    removed in the same write that claims the report as it is left, so one report reaches it
    once, and a start that never finishes, or a report that cannot be left, leaves it owed (and
    kept in a file again, where its file is gone and the chat does not start after all). A
    chat a Resume started knows the chat it resumed (`identity.resumed_from` in
    `app/reopen.json`), so **a report that lands after the Resume** goes to it as its record
    ends. Written by the app, as the report is kept, and by the settle that ends a dispatch
    whose chat is not coming back. Never set for a task the person started from a tab, whose
    report is theirs (D-1443-9).
  - `asker_last_record` — the newest session record the asking chat wrote since this
    dispatch, by its project-relative path (#1513), where `asker.session_record` keeps the
    first, which lists the dispatch on it. What a Resume of any of that chat's records is
    matched by.

  **A finished task's row** is every record with `mode: "task"` and a `report`, not `cleared`,
  whose `asker.id` is the id of a chat the app has open and whose `worker.id` is not, oldest
  first. **By id and never by number**: a number is dealt again in another launch, so a
  record that names its asking chat by number alone has no row. So the rows are there again
  after the app is quit and reopened, with no other store. **A task that had reported when the
  app quit is not started again**: at the next launch its chat is left out of what is put
  back (`dispatched::left_out_at_launch`) and it is a finished row, unless it was blocked,
  `kept_open`, started by the person, or its asking chat is not coming back. How a row ended:
  `ended_by: "person"` says the person ended it, and `ended_way` which way (#1488):
  `"stopped"` is "stopped by you" (it sent the one short report it was given a turn for, which
  is the record's `report`), and `"closed"`, no `ended_way` or the outcome `stopped` is
  "closed by you" (no report; the record's text is purlis's). `ended_way` is written only
  beside `ended_by: "person"` or `"limit"`, by the app, in the write that ends the record, and is absent on
  every other record but `ended_by: "limit"`, whose row is "stopped at its time limit", or
  "stopped with the task above it" for a `limit` of kind `above` (#1512). `ended_by: "unreported"` is "ended without a report"; else the report's
  outcome. A chat that lists its tasks is told the same two ends as "stopped by the person"
  and "closed by the person". `done` and `cancelled`
  fold into the window's one "Finished (n)" line; every other end stays a row of its own until
  cleared. **A reported task's own finished rows go when purlis ends it**: it is their asking
  chat, and it has closed. `purlis dispatch list` lists the same records after the asking
  chat's open tasks, until the row is cleared or that chat closes.
- **A task that did not start** (#1497): a task that was let through and started no chat
  still has a record, written by the app at that moment and ended in the same breath. Two
  more keys say so:
  - `did_not_start` — `true` for a task that did not start: the profile's program was missing
    or did not answer as its harness, the sandbox would not wrap it, there was no
    pseudo-terminal, its folder or workspace was gone, its worktree could not be cut, or a
    limit had filled between the person's Allow and the start; and for a task a launch could
    not start again **that the person then ended** (End task on its row). Absent for every
    other dispatch. Its `report` is then `{"outcome": "failed", "text": "it did not start:
    <reason>"}`, where the text is purlis's own sentence around the reason the start gave, on
    one line, cut at a character with `…` past 3600 bytes.
  - `attempts` — how many starts of the task were refused, where the asking chat tried again
    and it was more than one: an integer of 2 or more. Absent for one. Each try writes a
    record; the newest counts the earlier ones of the same asking chat and task name that did
    not start and were not yet cleared, and marks them `cleared`, so they are one row with
    the latest reason.

  **For a task no chat ever was**, `worker` is the chat it would have been: the number it was
  dealt and no `id`. That number is nobody's: such a record is never matched to a chat by it,
  and its row is listed whatever chat later has the number. `ended` equals `started`. A
  worktree cut for it and taken back whole is not named; one that could not be taken back,
  or whose branch git kept, is named in `place.worktree` (repo, folder and branch), because
  it is still on the disk. **For a task that had run and that the person ended**, the record
  is the one it was running under: `worker` keeps the chat's `id`, and `conversation` is the
  one it was in, which Reopen resumes. Its row is drawn only while that chat is not open, as
  every finished row is.

  **It is a finished task's row like the others**: `failed`, a row of its own that never
  folds, cleared by Clear finished and gone when the asking chat closes, and there again
  after the app is quit and reopened. `purlis dispatch list` says `did not start` for it. A
  record of this kind is written for a chat's own task and for one the person allowed from a
  Notice, never for a refusal made before a start was tried on the asking chat's own command,
  which that command answers, and never for a start the person's stop refused.

  **A launch writes nothing here.** A task a launch could not start again stays in
  `app/reopen.json` with its dispatch record still running, and is tried again at the next
  launch. The window draws it under the chat that asked, from those two files and no third,
  until it starts or the person ends it.

  **A task that had not reported when the app quit is brought back** (#1513, V100-63), under
  its asking chat, by the lineage on its own entry in `app/reopen.json` (`from`), and on its
  conversation, with one sentence of purlis's as its first message telling it to carry on,
  never its brief. purlis tells it so only where this store agrees: a running `task` record
  that owes a report, whose `worker.id` is that chat's and whose `asker.id` is the chat the
  entry names as the one that asked, running as the persona the dispatch went to (an entry
  whose id an earlier entry has is vouched for in nothing). **One that cannot be told so has
  ended by itself**: a task with no conversation to resume, or no profile to start on, is not
  started at all (a fresh chat would need its brief a second time), whether or not its asking
  chat comes back. Its record ends as `ended_by: "unreported"`, with a report text that says
  purlis was restarted and why, its `conversation` kept for a Reopen, and the chat that asked
  is told in the words a task whose program ended is told, once. **A refused start is not an
  end**: a task the launch tried and could not start (every agent stopped, a profile to approve
  again, a folder that moved) waits in the list of chats that did not start with its record
  running, drawn under its asking chat (#1497), and **Try to start again** starts it told
  to carry on; **End task** on that row ends it, and its asking chat is told. After the put-back, **where the record of open chats was read or
  the person chose to start fresh**, a running record whose chat neither came back nor waits
  to start has ended the same way, and where it was a task owing a report to a chat, it is
  marked `undelivered`; so is one the open of the project settles. A record that could not be
  read ends nothing. **A brief is not dispatched a second time**: a chat whose current run
  began after it dispatched a task (purlis restarted it, it was started again or cleared; its
  run's id is a later ULID than the record's `id`) that sends the same brief to the same
  persona, while that task's chat is open and its record running, is refused with the task's
  number.
- **The messages it keeps** (#1495): `talk` is a list of
  `{"at", "kind", "text"}`, one for each message purlis took between the two chats while the
  dispatch ran. `at` is when the app took it (UTC, as `started`); `kind` is `"follow_up"` or
  `"answer"`, which the asking chat sent, or `"note"` or `"question"`, which the persona chat
  sent: **the kind says which of the record's two chats said it**, so a line names no chat;
  `text` is the message as it was sent. **One message is neither chat's** (#1496): an answer
  the person gave in the purlis window, to a question the persona chat put to its asking
  chat, has `"by": "person"` beside its `"kind": "answer"`, and the Activity tab then says
  "you" answered. `by` is absent on every message a chat sent, `"person"` is its only value,
  and a record with any other value there is not read as a record. It is written by the app
  where it takes the person's answer from the window (`dispatchrecord::said_by`), and by
  nothing a chat can ask for: no command, hook or tool of a chat's carries it. Such an answer
  may also have `"unread": true`: the task ended (it reported, or its chat ended) before any
  turn of it was handed the answer, so the Activity tab says the answer was never read and
  does not show it as one the task worked from. The app writes it as the dispatch ends
  (`dispatchrecord::answer_unread`), from what it still held for the task; absent otherwise.
  **A message whose text reads like a credential is kept without its text** (#1520): `text`
  is `""` and `"left_out": true` beside it, decided as the app takes the message by the rule a
  session record is refused by (`secretshape::kind_as_read`, the whole message before any
  cut), so a token one chat hands another is never written here. It is counted and kept as any
  message is, so it leaves no hole, and the Activity tab says its text was left out. Absent
  otherwise; a record that has it beside a `text` that is not empty is not drawn.
  The number the app gives each question (what an answer is for) is in the app's memory only
  and is not written here. It is appended in the write that counts the message
  (`messages`), by the app, where it has already left the message for its reader. The message
  itself waits under `handbacks/said-<chat>/` only until that chat reads it, which is why a
  copy is kept here: the Activity tab is read afterwards. **Only what one chat sent another
  through purlis is kept; nothing of either chat's conversation is.** A message's text is held
  to 4 KiB, which is what a message may be, and a record keeps at most 500 messages and
  256 KiB of their text together: **the first ones are kept, with no hole**. One past either
  cap is counted in `messages` and its text is not kept, and after it no later message's is
  either, however small, so `messages` above `talk`'s length is exactly the messages after the
  last one kept, and a question is never dropped with its answer kept. A record written before
  the key has `messages` and no `talk`, and keeps none while it runs on. A record that has
  ended keeps no more. **The words are kept for 30 days after the dispatch ended** (D-1495-12,
  `dispatchrecord::expire_talk`): then every `text` in `talk` is emptied, in place, and `at`
  and `kind` stay, as do the brief and the report. It is counted from `ended`, not from the
  record's last write, and it does not wait for either chat to go: a record is kept for as
  long as one of its chats is brought back at launch, and what was said in it is not. A
  message is never taken empty (but one `left_out`), so an empty `text` means its words were
  kept and are gone. **Clear finished forgets them sooner** (#1520): the window's Clear
  finished, and the asking chat's close, which clears that chat's finished rows, empty every
  `text` in `talk` in the write that sets `cleared` (`dispatchrecord::clear_forgetting`);
  the brief and the report stay. A task that ends after its asking chat closed (in the one
  short turn a close gives it, say) is cleared and forgotten the same way as it ends, since
  nobody is left to clear its row; not while the app quits, when every chat is kept. So is a
  task that opening the project, or a launch, ends because its chat did not come back, where
  its asking chat does not come back either (#1556, `dispatchrecord::settle`). A Reopen,
  which also sets `cleared`, forgets nothing.
  **Removing a workspace forgets them too** (#1520): `purlis workspace remove` and the window's
  Remove empty `talk`'s texts on every ended record whose `place.workspace` is the workspace
  removed (`dispatchrecord::workspace_removed`), and say how many records of work in it stay,
  each with its brief and report, until they are collected, and how many of those are still
  running and keep their words until they end and for 30 days after. Where the store cannot be read
  (a sandboxed chat runs the command), the removal says so and the words stay until they
  expire.
  The app does this when it opens a project, over every record, once a day while the project
  is open, over every record again (#1556), and as it reads a timeline, over the records that
  timeline reads. A dispatch that
  has not ended keeps its words; **one whose `ended` does not read as a time, or stands more
  than five minutes after the app's clock, has them emptied at once** (#1520), since its 30
  days cannot be counted. `talk` is read back under the
  record's own check (`dispatchrecord::sound`): a record whose `talk` holds text purlis will
  not draw, more than 500 messages, or more than 256 KiB of their text, or whose `started`,
  `ended` or any `at` does not read as a time, or whose `ended` is before its `started`, is
  counted and never shown. **The
  one writer of `talk` is `dispatchrecord::said`** (`said_by`, for the person's answer, is
  the same write).
- **In a chat's Activity tab** (#1495): one timeline for a chat, oldest first, of every task
  it dispatched and every task under those (`mode` `"task"`; a handoff is on none). A record
  gives it the dispatch (`started`, `brief`, and `asker.by_person` for a task the person
  dispatched themselves), each line of `talk`, one line for the messages `talk` does not hold
  (`messages` above its length: sent before the key where `talk` is absent, else past the
  500 or the 256 KiB), and the report (`ended`, `report.text`, `report.outcome`). A task's own
  lines keep the order the record holds them in, whatever their times say. A report's line
  also lists the files it says it changed: `report.changed.files`, then every word of
  `report.changed.said` that reads as a file (its last part has an extension), so that a file
  another task's report also names is marked. Two tasks mark each other only where they
  worked in the same place (`place.workspace` and `place.folder`), so a task on a branch of
  its own marks nothing, and only where they ran at the same time, from `started` to `ended`
  (#1520), so a long-lived chat's common files are not marked on every task it ever ran. That is a reading of a chat's claim for a mark the person sees, and
  decides nothing (`purlis_core::activity::paths_named`). Nothing else is stored for the tab.
  **What the tab does not list:** a record that does not pass the check is counted on the
  timeline of the chat that asked for it and shown on none; a file that does not parse as a
  record of this version at all is skipped and counted nowhere, as in the Dispatches tab.
  **A timeline is bounded** (#1520, `activity::Bounds::TAB`): it reads the project's newest
  2,000 records, found by their file names (a ULID sorts by the time it was minted; a name
  minted more than five minutes after the app's clock is taken as the oldest, so files named
  in the future cannot push the real records out of the read, #1556), and
  lists the newest 200 tasks the chat dispatched itself, each with every task under it, so a
  listed task's parent is always listed; the tab says how many older tasks of the chat's own
  it does not list, and that older records were not read where there are any. Both bounds
  are the core's, handed to the tab. The 30-day expiry runs on that one
  read, so a timeline reads the store once; a record older than the 2,000 is expired by the
  daily sweep, or when the project is next opened.
- **Its own worktree** (#1453): a dispatch asked for with `--in worktree`, or to a persona
  whose definition says `dispatch-isolation: worktree`, gives its persona chat a worktree the
  **app** cuts, by the brokered route (ADR 0067 §2), off the clone the asking chat works in.
  `place.workspace` is that clone's workspace, `place.folder` the worktree's folder
  (`workspaces/<ws>/.worktrees/<repo>/<piece>`), and `place.worktree` is:
  - `repo` — the clone it was cut from, by its name in that workspace;
  - `piece` — the worktree's folder name, which purlis chose: the task's name as a branch name
    can carry it (letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`; `task` where nothing of it can), a `-`, and
    the last eight characters of this record's `id`, lowercased. So the record's id is minted
    before the worktree is cut, and two dispatches never share a folder or a branch. Nothing a
    chat sends is read as a folder or a branch;
  - `branch` — the branch purlis cut it on, as git printed it: the same name as `piece`. **It
    is what a task's report names as its branch** (`report.changed.branch`, and the line the
    asking chat's turn is told), whatever the persona chat says;
  - `removed` — `"merged"` once purlis found that branch merged into the branch it was cut
    from and took the worktree away, folder and branch; `"merged_branch_kept"` where it took
    the folder and git would not delete the branch; `"discarded"` once the person
    discarded its folder from the window, which deletes the branch only where git finds it
    merged, so a branch that holds a commit found nowhere else is still in the repo. Absent
    while the worktree is kept, and for one removed by other means, which the folder's absence
    says. Written once, and never for a dispatch still running.

  **purlis merges nothing for a dispatch by itself, and no chat can have purlis merge it.** The
  person may, from the task's Changes tab in the window (#1511): a fast-forward of `branch`
  into the branch it was cut from, of the commit they were shown, or nothing, and never while
  the task runs or a chat stands in its folder. That writes nothing to the record; the look
  that follows it is the one below. purlis looks at a kept worktree when its chat is closed,
  when the project is opened and after the person's merge, at no other time, and takes it
  away only where every
  commit of `branch` is in the branch it was cut from (`branch.<branch>.charterBase`, below)
  and the folder holds nothing else: no uncommitted path, and no ignored path that is not
  purlis's own layer. **A record's worktree is the one purlis cut for that dispatch and no
  other**: a record whose `piece` does not end with the end of its own `id`, or whose `branch`
  is not its `piece`, names no worktree purlis looks at or offers to discard. **Which
  repository that folder belongs to is purlis's record too**: for each of those looks, and for
  a discard, git is given the git directory the clone keeps for the piece
  (`<clone>/.git/worktrees/<piece>`) and the folder itself, after the folder's `.git` line is
  checked to name exactly that directory. A folder that names another is left as it is, and
  the window says so in one sentence (`purlis_core::worktree::pointer::verified`).
- **What a task changed is not kept here** (#1511). A task on its own branch changed what that
  branch holds against the branch it was cut from, read from git. A task that worked in a
  folder other chats work in is told from them by the files its own edit tools wrote while it
  ran (the touching hook's line says whether its tool writes, `wrote`), which the app keeps in
  memory only, by chat, for the last 128 chats heard from (every chat's, so another chat's
  write to a task's file is marked, #1534), as it keeps the explorer's markers (D-86a): no
  store holds them, and after the app is started again its Changes tab says it cannot tell.
- **Status:** **internal** — written by the app alone, and read by the app and by
  `purlis persona stats`, which counts records by persona.
- **Who writes it:** the app, from its own record of the two chats
  (`purlis_core::dispatchrecord`, called from `app/src-tauri/src/dispatches.rs`): opened where
  the app starts the persona chat, counted where the board puts that chat in the needs-you
  queue, given each message where the app takes one between the two chats, closed where the
  app accepts its report or closes it. `conversation` is written by the same hand as the
  record ends, and `cleared` by the window's Clear finished and Reopen
  (`app/src-tauri/src/finished.rs`), which only the person runs, and by the app as the asking
  chat closes. **No line on the hook channel
  names a record, an asker or a cost**, so no line a chat sends makes a record or points one
  at another dispatch. A task's report does say how the task ended (done, blocked or failed),
  which is the persona chat's to say, and that outcome is written to the record of the
  dispatch that chat was started by. Three more things in it are a chat's: the brief, the report's text and each
  message in `talk`, which
  are its words, stored as written (the brief passed the dispatch's own checks, the
  report its summary's and a message the same rule as a report; a message whose text reads
  like a credential is kept without it (#1520), and nothing scans a brief or a report again at
  rest, D-1452-13), and `usage`, which
  is its harness's report, kept where no sandboxed chat can write it (above). A chat is matched to its
  record by its id; by its number only where the record has no id. A persona chat
  that ends owing a report is recorded as `failed`, "ended without a report". A sandboxed chat
  can neither read nor write the store: `app/dispatches/` is denied for both in every
  harness's compiled sandbox, under each spelling of the state folder, as the hook spool is
  (ADR 0067 §5 class 2, amended 2026-10-07). A brief or a report written for one persona is
  not readable by a chat running as another. A chat gets its own dispatch's report on the
  delivery path and its own list from the app's answer, never from the file.
- **Where the sandbox does not hold it:** in a project with no sandbox, and for a chat started
  without it, nothing but the file's mode (0600) protects the store. Every such chat can read
  every brief and report and can write, alter or remove a record; the mode keeps out other
  users of the machine only. A chat already running when a build with the denial arrives
  keeps the sandbox it started with until it is restarted.
- **Read back with a check:** what the window draws is only a record that reads as one the
  app would have written (`dispatchrecord::sound`): every text within its cap and none
  holding a control character, an invisible one or one that turns the words around it (a
  brief and a report may hold line breaks and tabs). A record that does not pass is counted
  in the Dispatches tab as one purlis will not draw, and is never tidied and shown. When the project is
  opened, a running record whose persona chat the reopen record does not bring back is ended
  the same way (`dispatchrecord::settle_on_open`); with a reopen record that cannot be read,
  none is.
- **Why not the dispatch log:** `personas/_dispatch/` is committed, and a brief and a report
  can hold whatever the work held. The log keeps its `handoff` row of four fields, and this
  record holds the rest on this machine only.
- **Also read by `purlis persona stats`:** its `DISP` column adds, to the committed log's
  count for a persona, one for every record here that names it, a task or a handoff, running
  or ended (`dispatchrecord::tally`). It reads the persona's name and nothing else of a
  record. Run by a sandboxed chat, which is denied the store, it says the records could not
  be read and that `DISP` is the log's count alone: an unreadable store is never reported as
  no dispatches.
- **In the Dispatches tab:** a record that has not ended and whose persona chat this app does
  not have open (one the reopen record lists that was not brought back) is said to be `not
  open`, with no duration: it is not running, and runs again when its chat is opened.
- **Tier:** Clone state — session data, not readable by a sandboxed chat: collected 30 days after its dispatch ended (one that has not ended, whose end does not read as a time, or that still owes its asking chat a report, 30 days after it was last written), unless the chat that asked or the chat that worked is one the reopen record brings back (`retention::on_open`, `dispatchrecord::aged_from`). What the two chats said to each other is kept in it for 30 days after the dispatch ended, and for no longer where the record lives on (`dispatchrecord::expire_talk`). Deleting one costs its row in the Dispatches tab and its lines in the Activity tab of the chat that asked (the dispatch, what was said, the report), and nothing else: a task still running loses its record and reports to its asking chat as before.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).

### `app/dispatches/refused-while-away.json`
- **What:** the dispatches a chat nobody was at was refused **for lack of a standing grant**
  (#1507; ruling V100-29). A chat running with its harness's permission prompts off dispatches
  under standing grants only, and is refused at once where none covers the pair: nothing is
  asked of it and nothing is held. This file keeps that it happened, so the title bar's
  needs-you list can say "`<persona>` wanted `<persona>` while you were away" when the person
  is back, with **Dismiss**, **Never for this pair** and **Allow from now on**. **It decides
  nothing**: no dispatch reads it, an entry is no grant and no held dispatch, and the chat that
  was refused is not waiting on it.
- **One entry a pair and workspace, never one a refusal:** a second refusal of the same asking
  persona, target persona and workspace raises `times` and moves `latest`. **At most 50
  entries** a project, dismissed ones included: past that a new pair is not kept, and a pair
  already there still counts. **An entry is dropped 30 days after its latest refusal**, from
  every read and at the next write.
- **Listed in an order a chat cannot move:** by `first`, oldest first. A repeat changes a
  count and a time and nothing about where the entry is listed.
- **Only a refusal a grant would mend is kept:** no standing grant between two different
  personas (the project's pair nobody on this machine has reviewed included). A refusal for a
  never, a policy lock, a limit, the loop rule, a profile that asks nobody, a chat started with
  no sandbox, a chat on no persona, or a list of nevers that does not read is not kept.
- **Format:** JSON, pretty-printed, trailing `\n`, mode 0600, replaced whole
  (`rewrite::replace`) under purlis's lock on the directory.
- **Keys:** `v` — `1`; `refused` — a list of `{"asking", "target", "workspace"?, "first",
  "latest", "times", "dismissed"?}`: `asking`, the persona the asking chat ran with, by the
  app's record of it; `target`, the persona it asked for; `workspace`, **where the refused
  task would have worked** (#1505: the workspace a dispatch names or a handoff moves into, by
  the app's own lookup of it, else the asking chat's own), absent for the project's root;
  `first` and `latest`, when it was first and last
  refused, in seconds since 1970; `times`, at least 1; `dismissed`, when the person dismissed
  it, absent unless they did; `crossing`, `true` for a refusal of a crossing into another
  workspace (a chat nobody is at starting a chat as another persona there), absent
  otherwise. **A crossing entry is settled only by a grant that names the pair and covers
  that workspace**, never by "any persona", which is what it was refused despite. **Nothing a chat wrote is kept**: not the brief, not the task's
  name, not the chat's name or number. Every field is the app's own record, clock or count.
- **Dismissed holds:** Dismiss keeps the entry and writes `dismissed`. While it stands the
  entry is not listed, further refusals for it are counted without listing it, the asking
  chat's sentence gains no clause, and the entry still holds its place under the cap. It is
  listed again by a refusal that comes **seven days or more** after the dismissal, in the place
  it had, and by nothing else: time alone lists nothing.
- **Read back with a check:** an entry is listed only where it reads as one the app would have
  written: two different personas' names (a `"*"` is not one), a workspace that draws on one
  line within its bound, a count of at least one, `first` no later than `latest`, and no time
  ahead of the clock. One that does not is not listed and goes at the next write. A second
  entry for one pair and workspace is not a second row, and a key this build does not know is
  not read back. **A file that does not read lists nothing and is written over**: every entry
  is an offer, so losing one loses no refusal and no grant. A file whose `v` is another
  version lists nothing and is left as it is. Never read through a link.
- **What Allow from now on writes:** the dispatch grant for you on this machine for that one
  pair, **limited to the entry's workspace** (#1505: `app/sandbox.json` `dispatch_mine_in`),
  recorded in the event log first (`trust.dispatch.grant`, `level` `you`, no chat, `from`
  `"away"`, `workspace` the entry's). An entry for the project's root has no workspace to
  limit a grant to, so there it is the grant that holds in any workspace (`dispatch_mine`,
  `workspace` null), and the item says "in any workspace". **Its reach is that grant's**, and
  the item says so before the press: where it holds, that a chat nobody is at may use it too,
  and what the target works with in the dispatch question's own words (#1502), which names
  what the target's own chats may dispatch to onward. It starts nothing. It is made only for
  a pair this file lists in that workspace, and checked at the press: both names are personas
  of the project, no policy locks the pair, you have not said never to it, and **the
  workspace is one of the project's now**: for a name that is no workspace nothing is
  recorded and nothing is kept, and the item stays. Nothing here writes the project's file
  or "any persona". The entry then goes, and with a grant that holds in any workspace every
  entry for the pair.
- **What Never for this pair writes:** your never for the pair (`app/dispatch-never.json`),
  recorded in the event log first (`trust.dispatch.never`, no chat, `from` `"away"`), only for
  a pair this file lists. Every entry for the pair then goes, and no later refusal is kept
  for it.
- **By the time you look**, an entry whose pair you said never to, a policy locks, a grant
  already covers for work in its workspace, or whose persona is gone is taken out without a
  word. While your list of
  nevers does not read, or the project's personas cannot be read, nothing is offered and
  nothing is taken out.
- **Who writes it:** the app (`purlis_core::dispatchaway`, called from
  `app/src-tauri/src/dispatchaway.rs`), from its own record of the asking chat. **No line on
  the hook channel names an entry or answers one**, and the window's four commands for it are
  served on no link (`session-protocol` `ui::WINDOW_ONLY`). A sandboxed chat can neither read
  nor write it: it is in `app/dispatches/`, denied for both in every harness's compiled
  sandbox, so a chat does not read which pairs are about to be put to you. It is not a
  dispatch's record: it is not named by a ULID, so the Dispatches tab, `purlis persona stats`
  and the 30-day sweep of records pass it by.
- **Where the sandbox does not hold it:** in a project with no sandbox, and for a chat started
  without it, the chat runs as you and can write this file, as it can write a grant itself
  (`app/sandbox.json`). The check on reading and the checks at the press are what stand then.
  Nothing is kept on such a chat's own word: its refusal is for having no sandbox.
- **Tier:** Clone state — deleting it empties the list of what was refused while you were
  away, forgets what you dismissed, and changes no grant and no never (ADR 0069).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.purlis/`).

### `app/spend/<chat>.json` — what a chat's harness says its session has cost
- **Format:** one line of JSON and a trailing newline: `{"input_tokens": n, "output_tokens": n,
  "cost_usd": x}`, each key present only where the harness's payload carried it. Written over
  whole at each render: the figures are the session's running totals, so the last is the one
  kept. `<chat>` is the chat's own id (its ULID, ADR 0066), never its conversation.
- **Status:** **internal** — **purlis only** (#1452, moved here by #1457). Written by
  `purlis statusline` from Claude Code's per-turn payload (`cost.total_cost_usd`,
  `context_window.total_input_tokens`, `context_window.total_output_tokens`), under the chat
  the app started the harness as (`$PURLIS_CHAT_ULID`, which the app sets at the launch and a
  profile cannot). A payload that carries none of the three writes nothing, and nor does a
  harness the app did not start: **no file is "no cost reported", never a zero**. A harness
  with no status line (Codex, opencode) has none.
- **Out of a chat's reach** (D-1452-12). The folder is in the app's own (`app/`), which every
  harness's compiled sandbox denies a chat writing (ADR 0067, integrity). The one writer is the
  status line, which Claude Code runs outside the sandbox its tools run in, from the payload it
  hands it; a harness held whole inside purlis's wrap (Codex, opencode) cannot write it. Which
  file is a chat's is the app's fact, not a conversation a chat's hooks named. A chat with no
  sandbox runs as the person and can write it, as it can every file of `app/`. Before #1457 the
  figure was `sessions/<sid>.spend`, in a folder a chat writes; that file is no longer written
  or read.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `purlis_core::usage::record_spend`, from `purlis statusline`.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::usage::spent`: by the app when a dispatch ends, for the dispatch's
  record (`app/dispatches/`); for a tab's tasks' tokens (#1500); for a session's
  `tokens-per-session` (#1512).
- **Git:** gitignored. Collected when untouched for 30 days unless the reopen record brings the
  chat back (`retention::on_open`).

### `app/hooks.sock`
- **Format:** a unix socket, not a file. Each chat's hooks write one JSON line to it with the
  chat's number and token (`hookwire`), and the app answers. One kind of line, `touching`, names
  the file a chat's file tool touched, for the tree's live marker (FM-6). **It is never stored**:
  never spooled, never in the event log (which keeps only the arguments' digest), never in
  `app/reopen.json` or any other file here (D-86a).
  Another, `doing`, says what a chat's tool hook saw, for the one line a working chat's row
  says under its name (#1493): `{"chat": <n>, "doing": {"is": "began", "kind": "<kind>",
  "name": "<name>"}}` before a tool runs, and `{"is": "ended", "kind": "<kind>"}` after one
  comes back. It is sent only for a call that will run: not for one purlis's guard refused, nor
  for one the person is being asked about. **It is never stored either**: sent once, never
  spooled, never in the event log, a dispatch record or the Activity view. The app keeps the
  latest per chat in memory, replaces it at the chat's next one, and drops it when the chat's
  turn ends, when the chat asks the person something, and when the chat closes. The window is
  told at most four times a second per chat (`chat-doing`).

  | `kind` | While the tool is in flight | Once it has come back | `name` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `thinking` | thinking | | none |
  | `command` | running a command; running `cargo` | ran a command; ran `cargo` | a program on the list below |
  | `editing` | editing a file; editing `<file>` | edited a file; edited `<file>` | the file's base name |
  | `reading` | reading a file; reading `<file>`; reading 3 files | read a file; read `<file>`; read 3 files | the file's base name |
  | `searching` | searching | searched | none |
  | `fetching` | fetching a page | fetched a page | none |
  | `helper` | waiting on a helper | a helper finished | none |
  | `dispatching` | dispatching a task | dispatched a task | none |
  | `asking` | asking a question | asked a question | none |
  | `reporting` | writing its report | wrote its report | none |
  | `tool` | using a tool (a tool purlis has no word for) | used a tool | none |

  The list is fixed, the sentences are the window's own, and a line whose `kind` is not in it
  is dropped whole.

  **Nothing is said that was not heard.** `thinking` is said only from a turn's start until
  the first tool heard in it. After that the line keeps the last thing heard: in the present
  while its tool is in flight, in the past once a hook says a tool of that kind came back,
  until the next tool heard. A tool no hook is armed on says nothing, and the line keeps what
  it last said. Where a harness has no hook after a tool (Claude Code's `Read` and `Grep`, all
  of Codex), nothing says the tool came back, so the line stays in the present until the next
  tool heard: that is the one inexactness left. `dispatching`, `asking` and `reporting` are
  said by the app alone, when the chat's own dispatch, question or report reaches it; on the
  wire those kinds, and `thinking`, read as `tool`, so a chat cannot write by hand that it
  made a report. A chat the app has not heard begin a turn has no line (a harness that sends
  no events, Codex with its hooks untrusted), and a helper's tools do not change its chat's
  line.

  **`name` is the only word of the chat's that can reach the row, and the app believes none
  of it.** The hook applies the rule and the app applies it again:
  - a program is named only if the command's first word is, whole and as written, one of a
    fixed list (`purlis_core::doing::PROGRAMS`): `cargo`, `rustc`, `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`,
    `yarn`, `node`, `deno`, `bun`, `python`, `python3`, `pip`, `uv`, `pytest`, `go`, `make`,
    `cmake`, `git`, `gh`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `terraform`, `purlis`, `tsc`, `eslint`,
    `prettier`, `vitest`, `jest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `mvn`, `gradle`, `dotnet`, `swift`,
    `xcodebuild`, `rg`, `grep`, `ls`, `cat`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `wget`, `jq`. It is a list
    and not a rule over the first word, so that every command line a row can show is one
    purlis wrote: no path, no extension, no other case, and no shell builtin or wrapper (`cd`,
    `sudo`, `env`, `bash`, `sh`, `time`, `nohup`, `xargs`). Those, a variable set in front of
    a command, and every program not listed read "running a command";
  - a file's base name is kept only if it is ASCII letters, ASCII digits and `._-+@~#`, at
    most 48 characters. Anything else (a space, a control or formatting character, markup, a
    letter of another script) is dropped and the row reads "editing a file".

  Never a command's arguments, a URL, a search's pattern, a folder, a tool's own name, or
  anything a tool came back with. A file's base name can itself say something
  (`acquisition-acme.md`), and it is shown in the window, as its whole path is by the tree's
  live marker. Which tools are heard is which tools a hook is armed on (`hookreg`): for Claude
  Code, before `Bash`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Task`, `Agent` and
  purlis's dispatch tools, and after `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Task`, `Agent`
  and `Skill`; every opencode tool before it runs; Codex's shell alone.
- **Status:** **internal** — bound by the app while a plane is open and gone with it. Nothing
  reads it but the connection it serves. **purlis only.**
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — it lives as long as the app has the plane open.
- **Written by:** `hooks::socket_for` names it and `hookwire::Listener::bind` binds it
  (`app/src-tauri/src/hooks.rs`, `crates/purlis-core/src/hookwire.rs`). When
  `<plane>/.charter/app/hooks.sock` would be longer than a socket path may be (104 bytes on
  macOS), it is `charter-<user>-<16 hex>/hooks.sock` under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, else the per-user
  temp directory, instead. The path is handed to each chat as `$CHARTER_HOOK_SOCKET`.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).

### `app/spool/<n>/`
- **Format:** a folder per chat, `<n>` the chat's number, with one file per hook line the host
  did not take within 250 ms (FD-30, ADR 0068 §6, #983):
  - `<key>.<seq>.json` is one spooled line: `{"v": 1, "seq": <n>, "key": "<16 hex>", "line":
    "<the hook's line, as JSON text>", "mac": "<64 hex>"}` and a newline. `seq` counts from 1 per
    key; `key` names the key the line checks under; `mac` is HMAC-SHA256, under that key, of the
    chat number, `seq` and `key` (each followed by a newline) and then `line`'s bytes. A line
    holds no token. The name's `<key>` and `<seq>` are the line's own, `<seq>` in decimal, and
    the file holds that one line: the drain reads no other. A file with this name is whole and
    is never written again.
  - `<key>.<seq>.part` is a number a hook has taken and is still writing its line under, or took
    and died before it finished. It is never read as a line.
- **Status:** **internal** — written by `charter hook` and `purlis git-hook` of the same build,
  read by the app.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — each line is removed by the drain at the next open of the
  project, or when its chat is closed.
- **Written by:** `purlis_core::hookwire::spool::append`, **under no lock**: hooks of one chat
  that spool at once never wait for each other. A hook takes the next number by making
  `<key>.<seq>.part` exclusively (the one after the highest number the folder's names hold for
  its key or `keys.json` says was drained under it, whichever is higher, and the one after
  that if another hook took it first; `keys.json` is read once the number is taken, and a
  number a drain had already handed on is let go), writes its line into it,
  `fsync`s it, links it as `<key>.<seq>.json`, removes the `.part` name and `fsync`s the folder
  (and `spool/` too, for a new folder), all before the hook answers its harness. That survives
  a host crash. It is the ordinary `fsync`, so on macOS a power loss can still lose the line.
  The folder is mode 0700 and each file 0600, the folder opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` and every
  file made through it. **A hook gives a line 1 s to be written**, and a folder that already
  holds 16,384 names, of any kind, takes no more. Past the cap, or on a disk that refuses the
  write, the hook says the line is lost. Past the second it says the line may be lost: the
  write is left to finish, and the drain records the line if it did.
  **Only in a project's `.charter/app/spool/`** (V63): beside a fallback socket
  (`charter-<user>-<16 hex>/`) nothing is spooled, and the hook says the line is lost.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::hookwire::spool::drain`, from `Hooks::drain_spool` in the app,
  when a project is opened and before any chat starts, and `spool::end_chat`, from
  `Hooks::chat_ended`, for one chat as it is closed. Either holds an exclusive lock on `spool/`
  and on the folder, which only another drain and a token being issued wait for. Each `.json`
  file is checked: its key must be one `keys.json` holds for this chat, its MAC must be its
  own, and its line must name this chat.
  **A key's numbers go on from the highest one drained** (`drained` in `keys.json`, V99i): a
  line at or below it is `repeated`, unless its number is one no drain has handed on yet
  (`missing`), and then it is handed on, once. So a line put back after it was drained is
  rejected, whether that drain finished or stopped part-way. A number missing between
  `drained` and the highest line there is a gap, said once, whether or not a `.part` file
  holds it; a drain after one that stopped part-way says no gap for what the first one took.
  Lines removed from the end are not found, and neither is every line above `drained`,
  removed together: a hook that comes after takes their numbers. A name that is not a plain file of at most 1 MiB,
  not UTF-8, not one spool line, or not the line its name says, and any name a hook does not
  give, is `unreadable`, and the drain carries on past it. A `.part` file with no line of its
  name yet is `unfinished`, said at each drain that sees it. A line the chat's `<n>.jsonl` gave in the
  same drain (the same key, number and MAC) is `repeated`. Lines under two keys are handed on
  in the order `keys.json` holds the keys. Every line the drain handed on is recorded before
  its file is removed. The drain removes the files it read and the names it could not read
  (a directory among them stays, and is said again), and no other; the chat's folder itself is
  never removed. A `.part` file last written an hour ago or more, or dated in a time to come,
  is a dead hook's, and is removed. **A line a hook is still writing while the drain runs is
  recorded by the next one**: it is a gap at this drain if a later line was there, it stays in
  the folder, and the next drain of the chat hands it on, since the key is kept while the chat
  is open. A hook that outlives a drain numbers its next line after `drained`, and that line is
  handed on too. A line spooled after its chat ended has no key any more, and is `no-key`. A
  crash after the lines were recorded and before `keys.json` was written hands them on again
  at the next drain; one after that write and before the files went has them `repeated`, and
  removed.
  **`repeated` is not only a line somebody put back.** It is also said, with nothing put back,
  of: a line in `<n>.jsonl` under a key this build issued; a line a hook of a build before #983
  appended to `<n>.jsonl` after a drain emptied it; a line of a hook that could not read
  `keys.json` and found the folder empty after a drain, so numbered from 1; a line that landed
  late under a number past the 64 runs kept as `missing`; and a line a drain had recorded when
  the app stopped between writing `keys.json` and removing the file. In the first four the
  line's content is not recorded; in the last it was recorded, once.
  **A late line is filed under the chat's current run.** A chat the reopen record brings back
  keeps the key of its start before, and a line that lands under that key is recorded at the
  next drain under the run the chat is in then, not the start that wrote it.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`). A sandboxed chat is denied reading and writing the
  whole `spool/` directory (ADR 0067 §5's integrity class, V63).

### `app/spool/<n>.jsonl`
- **Format:** the spool of a build before #983: JSON lines, one per hook line, each the object
  a `<key>.<seq>.json` file holds now, appended to one file per chat under a lock on it.
- **Status:** **internal**, **read only** — no build writes it since #983. A hook of the build
  before still appends to it (ADR 0068 §6's N−1), so the app reads it at every open.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — emptied by the drain at the next open of the project.
- **Written by:** nothing in this build.
- **Read by:** `purlis_core::hookwire::spool::drain`, before the chat's folder and with the
  same checks, under an exclusive lock on the file. **A line is taken from it only under a key
  a build before V99i issued**, which is one `keys.json` holds with `file`: under a key this
  build issued every line in it is `repeated`, because this build's hooks never write it, and
  a line already drained from the folder could otherwise be put back here and taken again.
  Under a key with `file`, its numbers go on from `file`: a line at or below it is `repeated`,
  and a number missing between it and the file's own highest one is a gap. A hook of that
  build numbers from 1 again once the file is emptied, so a line it appends after a drain is
  `repeated` and not recorded, where it was `no-key` before. For a chat that was open across
  the change of builds, the folder and the file still count apart: a line taken from one and
  copied into the other after that drain is taken once more, until the chat ends. Every line
  the drain handed on is recorded before the file is emptied.
  It is emptied and left, never removed, so a hook holding it open appends to the file the
  next drain reads.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`), and denied to a sandboxed chat with the rest of
  `spool/`.

### `app/spool/keys.json`
- **Format:** JSON, `{"v": 2, "keys": [{"id": "<16 hex>", "chat": <n>, "key": "<64 hex>",
  "drained": <n>, "missing": [[<from>, <to>]], "file": <n>}]}`: one entry per chat token the
  app issued, in the order it issued them, **kept until the chat ends** (V99i, #983).
  - `key` is HMAC-SHA256 of the token under the label `charter hook spool v1`, and `id` the
    first 16 hex characters of its SHA-256. The token itself is never written.
  - `drained` is the highest number of this key's lines in `<n>/` that a drain has handed on,
    0 before the first. Only a line that passed every check moves it.
  - `missing` is the numbers below `drained` that no drain has handed on, as ranges with both
    ends included, lowest first: each was said as a gap when it was found. At most 64 ranges
    are kept per key, and the lowest go first past that.
  - `file` is there only for a key a build before V99i issued, which is one read from a
    version 1 file: it is `drained` for the key's lines in `<n>.jsonl`, the file of a build
    before #983, which has a sequence of its own. A key this build issues has no `file`, and
    no line in `<n>.jsonl` is taken under it.
  - **Version 1** (`{"v": 1, "keys": [{"id", "chat", "key"}]}`, written before V99i) is read
    as it is, each key with nothing drained and `file` 0, and is written as version 2 at the
    next write. **A version that is neither 1 nor 2 is refused**, however it is written (`3`,
    `3.0`, `"3"`): nothing is drained, no key is added, and the file is left as it is for the
    build that wrote it.
  - **A build before V99i does not refuse version 2.** It reads the file by its shape, takes
    every line under a key it finds with no look at `drained`, forgets the keys it drained,
    and writes the rest back without `drained`, `missing` and `file`, the version still 2.
    This build reads those keys as ones with nothing drained. Going back a build loses what
    was kept, and no line that build would not have lost anyway.
- **Status:** **internal** — written by the app alone; read by the app, and by `charter hook`
  and `purlis git-hook` for the one number `drained` under their own key.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — what lets a later app check a spooled line, and what
  keeps it from taking one twice. Deleting it, or a file that does not read as keys, makes
  every line still in a spool `no-key`, and the drain still finishes.
- **Written by:**
  - `purlis_core::hookwire::ChatTokens::issue`, through `spool::remember`, before the token
    reaches the chat: the key is added.
  - `spool::drain`, as a project is opened, after it has handed on each chat's lines and
    before it removes their files: `drained`, `missing` and `file` move. A drain that stops
    part-way keeps what it wrote for the chats it finished.
  - **A key is dropped when its chat ends**, and at no other time but one:
    - when the chat is closed (`spool::end_chat`, from the app's close of a chat, which a
      restart of a chat under a new number is too): the chat's spool is drained first, so a
      line spooled under the key is recorded, and then every key of that chat is dropped;
    - when a project is opened and the chat is not one the reopen record brings back
      (`spool::forget_all_but`, after a drain that finished);
    - and a key the same chat number was issued a newer one after is dropped by the next
      drain that finishes, which has drained its lines.
    So the file holds one entry per token issued to a chat that is still open since that
    chat's spool was last drained, and one per open chat after a drain. A chat that comes back
    at an open therefore holds two through its next run: the key of its start before, and the
    one it is issued now.
  - Every write is `rewrite::replace`, mode 0600, under an exclusive lock on the `spool/`
    directory that a drain holds from start to end. A hook reads the file under no lock.
  - Only in a project's `.charter/app/spool/`, and a sandboxed chat neither reads nor writes
    it (V63): it is a verifier at rest. Where no sandbox runs, the file's mode and its
    folder's (0600 in 0700) are what keep it from another user; a process of the same user
    can read it, as it can read the chat's token itself from the chat's environment. What the
    key gives its holder is spool lines that check as that chat's, under a number no drain
    has handed on; it does not let anything report on the live channel.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).

### Top-level markers, gates and ledgers

### `chat-turns/<chat>`
- **Format:** empty file; **the mtime is the value**
- **Status:** **stable** — written by the hooks (Python) on every tool call and read by the
  frame panel to animate "this chat is working". The canonical hook-writes/frame-reads pair.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/inflight.py:507` (`turn_begin`, `touch_for`),
  `charter/inflight.py:527` (`turn_bump`, `os.utime`), removed `charter/inflight.py:543`;
  callers `charter/hooks.py:5971`, `charter/hooks.py:6177`, `charter/hooks.py:8699`
- **Read by:** `charter/inflight.py:587` (`working_chats`),
  `charter/inflight.py:474` (`turn_stamp` — one `stat` of the directory),
  `charter/frame/panel.py:657`, `charter/frame/slots.py:5060`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** the file name is the chat id, refused unless it survives `_safe_name`
  unchanged (`charter/inflight.py:454`). Entries older than 10 min
  (`TURN_STALE_SECONDS`, `charter/inflight.py:415`) are deleted on read.
- **Collected (purlis):** no rule. purlis neither writes nor reads it, so nothing there grows
  (#1004).

### `dispatch-inflight/<agent>.<random>.json`
- **Format:** JSON `{"agent": str, "kind": str, "ts": float}`, no newline
- **Status:** **retired in purlis** (#1451) — it was written by the dispatch hook so that a
  persona declaring `dispatch-isolation: worktree` could be asked about before it shared a
  tree with a running agent. A persona is never a sub-agent now, so purlis neither writes
  nor reads it. (The key itself is read again, #1453: it gives a dispatched chat a worktree of
  its own, and nothing is asked.) `purlis doctor --fix persona-agents` removes the records
  left from before, and the folder once nothing else is in it (#1460).
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/inflight.py:246` (`start`, `tempfile.mkstemp` + `json.dump`);
  caller `charter/hooks.py:7954`. Also `kind="clone"` (`charter/commands.py:606`),
  `"gl-refresh"` (`charter/commands.py:1027`), `"action"`
  (`charter/frame/actions.py:370`)
- **Read by:** `charter/inflight.py:180` (`live_records`), `charter/statusline.py:1834`,
  `charter/frame/panel.py:580`, `charter/frame/slots.py:2573`
- **Removed by:** `charter/inflight.py:290`/`:305` (`finish`); anything older than 24 h
  (`PRUNE_SECONDS`, `charter/inflight.py:61`) is unlinked on read
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding caution:** the file is created by `tempfile.mkstemp`, i.e. **0600 but not
  through `config`**; the name is `<safe agent name, ≤64 chars>.<mkstemp tail>.json`
  (`charter/inflight.py:107`, `:244`). `kind` defaults to `"dispatch"` when absent
  (`charter/inflight.py:103`).

### `commit-gate/<sid>`
- **Format:** plain text, a small decimal integer (countdown), no newline
- **Status:** **internal** — a per-session cooldown counter for one nudge, written and read
  only by `hooks`. Deleted ⇒ the next prompt may nudge once more.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient — a gate file.
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:8322` / `charter/hooks.py:8324` (reset to
  `_COMMIT_COOLDOWN` = 3, `charter/hooks.py:8262`)
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:8320`
- **Git:** gitignored; filename is the sanitised session id (`charter/hooks.py:8319`)
- **Collected (purlis):** when the app opens the plane, a cooldown last written 30 days or more
  before is removed, unless its session is one the reopen record brings back. Losing one costs
  that session one more nudge (`retention::on_open`, #1004).

### `dispatch-commit.lock`
- **Format:** empty file, used with `flock(LOCK_EX)`
- **Status:** **stable** — a cross-process mutex around committing the dispatch record; any
  process that commits plane memory must take it.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written/locked by:** `charter/hooks.py:8209`
- **Git:** gitignored; deleted ⇒ recreated, but concurrent committers stop serialising.

### `guard-seen.json`
- **Format:** JSON object, `sort_keys=True`, trailing `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — written by the guard handler and read by `purlis doctor` in
  another process; it is the evidence that the guard is actually wired.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy — the next guarded call writes it again.
- **Written by:** `charter/guardseen.py:180` (`mark`), called from `charter/hooks.py:6222`
- **Read by:** `charter/guardseen.py:283` (`last`), `charter/doctor.py:2002`,
  `charter/doctor.py:2466`
- **Git:** gitignored (`charter/guardseen.py:38`)

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ts` | str, ISO-8601 UTC, seconds precision | yes (a record without it reads as absent) | when the guard last fired | stable | `charter/guardseen.py:168`, check `charter/guardseen.py:286` |
| `harness` | str \| null | yes | harness registry name | stable | `charter/guardseen.py:168` |
| `source` | `"plugin"` \| `"settings"` | yes | which declaration dispatched it | stable | `charter/guardseen.py:48`, `charter/guardseen.py:50`, decided at `charter/guardseen.py:55` |
| `claude_config_dir` | str \| null | only for Claude Code | `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in use | stable | `charter/guardseen.py:62`, written `charter/guardseen.py:176` |

Only the **latest** sighting is kept (whole-file overwrite).

### `mcp-approved.json`
- **Format:** JSON `{"<persona>": ["<sha256 hex>", …]}`, `indent=2`, `ensure_ascii=False`,
  trailing `\n`; the list is sorted
- **Status:** **stable** — an operator consent record; read by the persona renderer in every
  later process. Machine-local and deliberately not committed (`charter/mcpseen.py:42`).
- **Tier:** Clone state — the operator's consent.
- **Written by:** `charter/mcpseen.py:264` (`approve`), from
  `purlis persona … --approve-mcp` (`charter/commands_persona.py:2029`)
- **Read by:** `charter/mcpseen.py:241` (`_read`) → `approved` (`charter/mcpseen.py:250`),
  `charter/persona.py:779`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** the fingerprint is `sha256(consent line)` (`charter/mcpseen.py:236`); the
  per-persona set is **replaced**, never merged. Not present in the live plane.

### `agent-personas.json`
- **Format:** JSON object `{"<agent id>": "<persona>"}`, `sort_keys=True`, no newline
- **Status:** **retired in purlis** (#1451) — it was written by one hook event (dispatch)
  and read by a later one to attribute a message to the persona behind a sub-agent. No
  persona is behind a sub-agent now, so purlis neither writes nor reads it. `purlis doctor
  --fix persona-agents` removes one left from before, unless it is a link (#1460).
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:8098` (`_agent_map_remember`)
- **Read by:** `charter/hooks.py:8105` (`_agent_map_lookup`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** capped at 200 entries, oldest dropped (`charter/hooks.py:8096`); agent ids
  match `\bagentId:\s*([0-9a-f]{6,})` (`charter/hooks.py:8076`).

### `plane-push.json`
- **Format:** JSON object, `indent=2`, no trailing newline
- **Status:** **stable** — written by a **detached** background pusher that has no caller to
  tell, and read by `doctor` later (`charter/planegit.py:213`).
- **Tier:** Clone state — the push journal V2 names.
- **Written by:** `charter/planegit.py:280` (`record_push`); **deleted** when the push
  succeeded (`charter/planegit.py:277`)
- **Read by:** `charter/planegit.py:297` (`push_record`), `charter/planegit.py:340`
- **Git:** gitignored

| Field | Type | Meaning | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `outcome` | str, one of `pushed`/`branched`/`stranded`/`failed`/`conflict`/`unreachable`, and in purlis `pr-open`/`blocked` | what the push did; a record without it reads as absent. `pr-open`: a request mode pushed `head` to the save branch (`landed`) and its PR into `branch` is open (`url`, `number`). `blocked`: a request mode cannot go further without a person — its PR was closed without merging, the merged target no longer matches what was pushed, or somebody else pushed to the save branch (`detail` says which) | stable | `charter/planegit.py:190`–`:195`, `:300`; `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit/prsave.rs` |

| `url` | str \| null | PR/MR url | stable | `charter/planegit.py:282` |
| `number` | int \| null | **purlis only.** The PR's number (a GitLab MR's `iid`), written with `pr-open` and `blocked`; what the next save or fetch asks the forge about | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit.rs` `record_push` |

| `conflicts` | array of str, optional | **purlis only.** The files a rebase onto the remote conflicted in, read before the rebase was undone; present only when there were some (purlis#295). | stable | `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit.rs` `record_push` |

In purlis the save journal (below) takes over this record's job for saves made by
purlis. `purlis save` keeps writing this record until its contract moves (ADR 0051).

A `pr-open` or `blocked` record is judged against the remote-tracking target branch
(`refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`) rather than `@{upstream}`, and only while HEAD is `head` or
descends from it: a plane moved off that commit by hand is no longer the plane the record is
about. The next save or fetch settles a `pr-open` record by asking the forge where the PR stands
(purlis#298).

### `save-branch.json`
- **Format:** JSON object, `indent=2`
- **Status:** **internal** — what a request mode's saves keep about this clone's save branch, apart
  from `plane-push.json` because that record is rewritten by every push, failures included
  (purlis#298). Deleted ⇒ the next push leases the save branch as absent (and is blocked
  if the remote has one whose tip HEAD does not contain), and a PR opened before is not
  settled by charter: the plane stays on its commits until moved by hand.
- **Tier:** Clone state — part of the save journal.
- **Written by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit/prsave.rs` `Kept::write`, with
  `profiletrust::write_private`: after each push to the save branch, after each PR opened or
  updated, and when a PR is settled (merged and moved onto, or closed).
- **Read by:** the same module, on every request-mode save and fetch; `standing` for the PR's link.
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Fields:**
  - `branch`: the save branch the rest is about; anything kept about another is ignored
  - `pushed`: the commit this clone last pushed to it — what the next push is leased against
  - `pr`: `null`, or the PR last opened or updated and not yet settled: `number`, `url`,
    `head` (the commit it was last pushed at) and `target` (the branch it goes into)

### `save-journal.jsonl`
- **Format:** JSON Lines, one object per save attempt, appended. Capped at the newest 500
  lines.
- **Status:** **internal**. Only the app and `purlis save` write it, and only the Saving view
  reads it. Deleted ⇒ the Saving view's history starts empty.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the save journal V2 names.
- **Written by:** `crates/purlis-core/src/planegit.rs` `save_as`, the one save function
  (purlis#293, ADR 0051), and `crates/purlis-core/src/reposave.rs` `save_as` for a
  workspace repo (purlis#299), once per attempt, with `profiletrust::write_private`.
- **Read by:** the Saving view (its last 50 entries).
- **Git:** gitignored (under `/.charter/`).
- **Fields:**
  - `at`: epoch seconds
  - `target`: `plane`, or `repo:<workspace>/<name>`
  - `trigger`: one of `manual`, `quiet`, `session-end`, `quit`, `launch`, `cli`, `live`, `rename`
  - `mode`
  - `files`: a count
  - `commit`: a sha or null. For a repo, HEAD once the save was done with it — the commit it
    made or pushed
  - `branch`: for a repo, the remote branch the save pushed (the branch the clone is on, or
    `charter/<workspace>/<short-sha>` in a request mode on the default branch); absent or null
    otherwise
  - `pr`: a url or null
  - `ms`: the duration
  - `outcome`: one of `saved`, `committed`, `pushed`, `pr-open`, `blocked`, `offline`,
    `skipped`, `failed`
  - `detail`: git's or the forge's own words

### `ws-edit-nudge/<sid>-<workspace>`
- **Format:** one byte, `1`
- **Status:** **internal** — "this session was already nudged about this workspace". Deleted
  ⇒ one extra nudge. Written and read only by `hooks`.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/hooks.py:7656`; existence checked `charter/hooks.py:7654`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** key is `f"{session}-{ws}"` with every char outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`
  removed (`charter/hooks.py:7652`) — **ambiguous by construction** (see the Appendix).
  Only written for a **live** workspace (`charter/hooks.py:7810`).
- **Collected (purlis):** when the app opens the plane, a marker last written 30 days or more
  before is removed, unless its name begins with a session the reopen record brings back,
  then `-`. Losing one costs that session one more reminder (`retention::on_open`, #1004).

### `ws-autosave/<workspace>`
- **Format:** plain text, `str(time.time())`, no newline; the mtime is what is actually read
- **Status:** **internal** — a 90-second debounce for the Stop-hook auto-save. Deleted ⇒ at
  most one extra commit attempt.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/commands_workspace.py:1179` (marker path
  `charter/commands_workspace.py:1171`)
- **Read by:** `charter/commands_workspace.py:1173` (mtime only)
- **Git:** gitignored; only ever written when `[memory] share` is not `local`

### `workspace-tab-order`
- **Format:** plain text, one workspace name per line, trailing newline per line
- **Status:** **stable** — the operator's tab order, written by the frame and read by every
  later frame/palette process.
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy — the operator's order.
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:1023` (`record_tab_order`, `replace_for` — atomic)
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:1060` (`tab_order`); removed by
  `charter/workspace.py:1079`
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** `"".join(f"{n}\n" for n in names)`; names failing `valid_name` are dropped
  on read (`charter/workspace.py:1063`).

### `workspace-arrivals/<workspace>`
- **Format:** empty file; existence is the payload
- **Status:** **stable** — one process records the arrival, another (the frame/status line)
  reads and clears it.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:1163` (`record_arrival`, `touch_for`)
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:1198` (`arrivals`), cleared `charter/workspace.py:1224`,
  all forgotten `charter/workspace.py:1238`
- **Git:** gitignored; the name must satisfy `valid_name` (`charter/workspace.py:1127`)

### `unrecorded/<sha256(realpath(tree))[:32]>.json`
- **Format:** JSON `{"errno": "<errno name or number>", "says": "<strerror>"}` + `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — written by the snapshot path and read by a later command/status
  render to explain why a tree could not be recorded.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable
- **Written by:** `charter/workspace.py:2977` (`_note_unrecorded`, atomic); removed when the
  write succeeds (`charter/workspace.py:2974`)
- **Read by:** `charter/workspace.py:2988` (`unrecorded_reason`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** filename derivation `hashlib.sha256(os.path.realpath(tree))[:32]`
  (`charter/workspace.py:2959`) — note it uses `mkdir_for`, not `private_mkdir`.

### `locks/harness-wiring-<digest16>.lock`
- **Format:** empty file, `flock(LOCK_EX)`
- **Status:** **stable** — serialises harness wiring across processes.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient, legacy
- **Written/locked by:** `charter/wiring.py:963` (path `charter/wiring.py:959`)
- **Git:** gitignored
- **Encoding:** digest = first 16 hex of `sha256(json.dumps({**profiletrust.fingerprint(p),
  "name": p.name}, sort_keys=True))` (`charter/wiring.py:957`)

### `active-workspace` (legacy)
- **Format:** plain text
- **Status:** **internal/dead** — derived (`charter/config.py:804`) and read by nothing in
  this tree; kept so old files do not error. Deleting it changes nothing.
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy

### `active-persona`
- **Format:** plain text, persona name + `\n`
- **Status:** **stable** — the plane-wide persona pointer used only when there is neither a
  session nor a terminal id (`charter/persona.py:1529`); read by `charter/persona.py:1222`.
- **Tier:** Clone state — the plane-wide persona pointer the operator chose.
- **Git:** gitignored

### `cache/` — derived data with a TTL

**Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable — every file below, unless its entry says otherwise.

All five are regenerated on demand; deleting any of them costs one slower render or one
extra network/git call. They are **internal** by the rule, but every one of them is written
by one process and read by another (the status line, the frame, a background refresher), so
a Rust reader that only *reads* them is safe while a Rust writer must keep the key and TTL
semantics below.

### `cache/repostate.json`
- **Format:** JSON object keyed by absolute repo path → `{"dirty": bool, "tracked_dirty":
  bool, "ahead": int, "behind": int, "ts": float}`; one line, no trailing newline
- **Status:** **internal** — a 5-second TTL cache of `git status --porcelain=v1 --branch`
  (`_STATE_TTL`, `charter/statusline.py:817`). Deleted ⇒ the next render shells out to git.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/statusline.py:844` (`_repo_states`)
- **Read by:** `charter/statusline.py:825`; the whole file is rewritten on any change
- **Git:** gitignored. Values: `charter/statusline.py:902`

### `cache/glstate.json`
- **Format:** JSON object keyed by absolute repo path → `{"branch": str, "ts": float,
  "change": int|null, "ci": str|null, "sigil": str}`
- **Status:** **internal** — forge (CI / open change) cache. Served for up to 2 h
  (`DISPLAY_TTL`, `charter/glstate.py:21`), refreshed after 5 min (`REFRESH_TTL`,
  `charter/glstate.py:22`). Deleted ⇒ the CI column is blank until a refresher runs.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable
- **Written by:** `charter/glstate.py:150` (`_save`), from the detached
  `purlis gl-refresh` (`charter/glstate.py:288`)
- **Read by:** `charter/glstate.py:141` (`load`), `charter/glstate.py:171` (`read_for`),
  and `gather.scan`
- **Git:** gitignored; an entry whose `branch` no longer matches is ignored
  (`charter/glstate.py:176`).

### `cache/glstate.refreshing`
- **Format:** plain text, the refresher's pid (or empty when done)
- **Status:** **internal** — spawn lock; **mtime carries the age**. Deleted ⇒ at worst a
  duplicate refresher.
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `charter/glstate.py:88` (`_write_lock`), cleared `charter/glstate.py:136`
- **Read by:** `charter/glstate.py:106` (`_read_lock`), liveness via `os.kill(pid, 0)`
  (`charter/glstate.py:119`)

### `cache/update.json` and `cache/update.checking`
- **Format:** `update.json` — JSON `{"latest": str, "ts": float, "head": str}` (one line);
  `update.checking` — empty file whose **mtime** is the spawn cooldown
- **Status:** **internal** — deleted ⇒ one more version check. `latest` is the newest
  released version, `head` the upstream dev sha (dev channel only).
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/update.py:467` (`fetch_and_store`), lock touched
  `charter/update.py:506`
- **Read by:** `charter/update.py:119` (`load`), `charter/update.py:331` (`newer_head`),
  `charter/update.py:351` (`newer_than`), `charter/update.py:500`
- **Git:** gitignored; refresh at most daily (`REFRESH_TTL`, `charter/update.py:53`)

### `cache/update-baseline`
- **Format:** plain text, a version string, no newline
- **Status:** **stable** — it is what the *news* range is computed from across upgrades, i.e.
  a later, different purlis reads what an earlier one wrote. Deleted ⇒ the news range
  degrades, never the update (`charter/commands_update.py:131`). **The app neither writes nor
  reads it:** its `purlis news` prints the app's own CHANGELOG.md and has no range view
  (purlis #352), so a baseline the Python charter left is history.
- **Tier:** Clone state, legacy — what the Python charter's news range started from; the Rust purlis neither writes nor reads it (`adopt.rs`).
- **Written by:** `charter/commands_update.py:129` (`_stamp_baseline`)
- **Read by:** `charter/commands_update.py:120` (`read_baseline`)
- **Git:** gitignored

### `cache/vaulthealth.json`
- **Format:** JSON object keyed by vault name → `{"ok": bool, "detail": str, "ts": float}`
- **Status:** **internal** — 60-second TTL (`_VAULT_TTL`, `charter/statusline.py:1650`).
  Deleted ⇒ the next render asks the provider again.
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/statusline.py:1691`
- **Read by:** `charter/statusline.py:1677`
- **Git:** gitignored. **`detail` is provider text and can name paths/accounts** — it is the
  one cache entry a UI must treat as possibly sensitive.

### `cache/harness-wiring.json`
- **Format:** JSON object keyed by a sha256 hex → `{"state": "wired"|"unwired", "detail":
  str, "fix": str, "checked_at": float, "stamp": {"<abs path>": [mtime_ns, size] | null}}`,
  `indent=2`, trailing `\n`
- **Status:** **internal** — remembered wiring verdict; 24 h TTL (`MAX_AGE`,
  `charter/wiring.py:89`) **and** invalidated when any stamped file changed
  (`charter/wiring.py:861`). Deleted ⇒ the selector re-checks (slower, correct).
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable, legacy
- **Written by:** `charter/wiring.py:890` (`remember`)
- **Read by:** `charter/wiring.py:838` (`_read_cache`), `charter/wiring.py:853` (`cached`)
- **Git:** gitignored; key = `sha256(json.dumps({**profiletrust.fingerprint(p), "name":
  p.name, "cwd": str(cwd)}, sort_keys=True))` (`charter/wiring.py:770`)

### `index/<clone-key>/` — the project's search index

- **Format:** **decided, not yet written** ([ADR 0079](adr/0079-search-runs-on-derived-sqlite-indexes-one-per-project-clone-and-one-per-machine.md)).
  `<clone-key>` is the first 16 hex characters of the SHA-256 of the clone's canonical root path, so
  two clones sharing a state directory through `$CHARTER_HOME` never share an index. Inside it:
  `current`, a plain-text file naming the live generation, and one directory per generation
  holding `search.sqlite` (SQLite in WAL mode, with its `-wal` and `-shm`): an item table (path,
  kind, owner, audience, approval state, workspace, persona, content hash, size, modification
  time), an FTS5 contentless table (`detail=full`: each term with its row, column and position,
  enough to reconstruct much of the wording, but no text as written), and a `meta` table (schema
  version, redaction rules version, the commit last reconciled, the time built). A span the
  shape scanner flags is indexed as its kind. A deleted item's rows stop answering at once, and
  its terms leave the file at the next FTS5 `optimize` plus `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` with
  `secure_delete` on; an unlinked old generation is not overwritten. A chat is answered only
  from its own `<clone-key>`
- **Status:** **internal**. Derived from the project's memory bases, session records and todos,
  read through `memstore::read_files`' gate. Deleted ⇒ `recall` and the briefing scan the files
  until `purlisd` has rebuilt it. A version it did not write is discarded and rebuilt, never
  migrated
- **Tier:** Clone state, rebuildable
- **Written by:** `purlisd`, its only writer (KN-2). A full rebuild writes a new generation and
  swaps `current` in one rename
- **Read by:** the app's panels, the hooks, the CLI and the palette, read-only
- **Git:** gitignored, with the rest of `.charter/`

### `index/<clone-key>/writer.lock`

- **Format:** an empty file, held with an advisory `flock` by the index's writer. **Decided, not
  yet written** (ADR 0079)
- **Status:** **internal**. A second writer waits on it rather than writing alongside
- **Tier:** Clone state, transient
- **Written by:** `purlisd` (KN-2)
- **Git:** gitignored

### State charter keeps **outside** the plane

* `$CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME` → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` → `~/.config`, then `charter/reporting-consent`
  — a plain text file whose **existence** is the Reporter's consent to open upstream issues
  (`charter/report.py:462`, `charter/report.py:465`, granted `charter/report.py:475`).
  **stable** (operator-visible, deleted by hand to withdraw), per *machine*, not per plane:
  one consent covers every plane the machine works on.
* **The kill switch** (OV-1, ADR 0071), written by the app **and** by `purlis stop --all`:
  `charter/halted`, an **empty** 0600 file whose **existence** means every agent purlis
  started on this machine is stopped; and `charter/kill-switch.jsonl`, JSON Lines, 0600, one
  object per event — `at` (epoch seconds), `event` (`stop`, `rearm` or `tamper`), `by`
  (`window`, `cli` or `app`; on a runner also `link`, **decided, not yet written**, ADR 0078) — capped at the newest 1000 lines. Written by
  `crates/purlis-core/src/halt.rs`. The machine is stopped when the marker is there **or**
  the journal's last event is not a `rearm`, so removing the marker alone re-arms nothing; a
  running app puts a removed marker back and journals a `tamper`. Only the app's window writes
  a `rearm`. While stopped, the app starts no chat and a relaunch puts no chat back. **stable**
  (a second process reads both). A process running as the operator can still edit both files
  (ADR 0071's residual).

* No other **state** in this area is written outside the plane, though purlis does write
  elsewhere: a news probe writes `$TMPDIR/charter-probe-<pid>` (`charter/news.py:1329`).
  Harness-side files
  (`~/.claude/...`, codex/opencode homes) belong to the config/harness area; this area only
  *stamps* them in `cache/harness-wiring.json`.

**What purlis keeps outside the plane** (ADR 0034, ADR 0069). `<config>` is the machine
store's directory: `$PURLIS_CONFIG_HOME`, else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, else `~/.config`, then
`purlis/` once rename-local has moved it, else `charter/` (the `CHARTER_` spellings of both
variables are read too, until 1.0), `0700`, and every file in it `0600` (`crates/purlis-core/src/machine.rs`). On a
platform that is not unix none of it is written (ADR 0031). **Rename window (RN-5):** the
folder is `purlis/` once `rename-local` has moved it (or it is the one there), else `charter/`;
the same rule holds for the session host's `purlisd/`/`charterd/` in it, for `<data>`'s folder and
for the app's log folder (`dev.purlis.app`/`dev.charter.app`). `rename-local` journals every move
in `<config>/rename-local/journal.jsonl` and lists each project whose state folder it moved in
`<config>/rename-local/state-moved`, one resolved root a line; `purlis migrate --undo` replays the
journal backwards. The keychain copy (RN-6) journals each item it writes under `purlis/…`
(`copied`), each keyring vault whose index it points from its `charter/…` service to the purlis
one (`switched`, with each key's `updated` then) and each identity record it gives
`"base": "purlis"` (`rebased`), each only after every item read back the same; the undo points
them back and keeps every item under both names. The copy never lets the Keychain ask (#1306): a
vault or record whose items would ask stays on `charter/…` and waits, held only in the app's
memory, until the window's *Finish moving* copies it with the Keychain's dialogs on; a terminal
copies only a vault whose index marks no key `held`. `.purlis.lock`, beside `<config>` in the config root, is an empty advisory lock:
the app and `mcp` hold it shared while they run, and `rename-local` takes it exclusively, so it
never moves the folders under them. The Tauri directories are the app's, identifier `dev.purlis.app` (`dev.charter.app` before RN-9). The keyring rows are the operating system's store (ADR 0047).
`<data>` is purlis's data home (ADR 0075, amending ADR 0069): `$PURLIS_DATA_HOME`, else
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/charter`, else the OS data directory's `charter/` (`~/Library/Application
Support/charter` on macOS, `~/.local/share/charter` on Linux); in each, the folder is `purlis/`
once rename-local has moved it, else `charter/`. The host's event log is written
there (FD-9, `purlis_core::datahome`). The other rows are **decided, not yet written**: AU-3
writes the audit's, RR-16 a runner's bare repos (ADR 0078), KN-32 the search index's
(ADR 0079), RC-7 the reviews (ADR 0084) and OB-2 the telemetry store (ADR 0083). Every writer
refuses a `<data>` under a project or inside any git work tree.

| Path | Tier | What it holds | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<config>/machine.json` | Machine, device-bound | the planes this machine opened (absolute paths), the operator's approval of each with what it would do when opened, the windows open at the last quit, pinned planes and workspaces, the update channel, and this device's id with when it was minted (`device`, ADR 0066: a ULID minted at the first launch that asks, and the key events and records name the device by). And the ISO week the updater last read the weekly manifest in (`weekly`, `2026-W41`, ADR 0083 as amended for OB-17): never sent, and the same value on every machine that checked that week. Pins and the channel are preferences, but they are keyed by absolute path and share one file with the approvals, so the file is device-bound as a whole | `machine::update`, from the app's opener and `purlis update --channel` |
| `<config>/machine.json.lock` | Machine, device-bound, transient | the `flock` that makes a read-modify-write of `machine.json` one act | `machine::update` |
| `<config>/layout.json` | Machine, syncable | the window's arrangement of regions, the two text sizes, your editor (RC-20, ADR 0081 §6: one of four words, never a program), and how chats are listed and summed up (`chats`, #1499: `lines`, 1 or 2, and `grouped`, whether its sessions are grouped by workspace; and #1489: `tabbed`, whether a pressed task opens in a tab of its own, where otherwise its session's tab is switched to it; and #1514: `away`, whether coming back to the window after a while away sums up what happened meanwhile; left out at the defaults, 2, `false`, `false` and `true`) | `windowprefs::write_layout`, `adopt_layout` (which moves the legacy `charter.layout` localStorage key into it once) |
| `<config>/theme.json` | Machine, syncable | the operator's own theme; purlis only reads it | the operator, by hand |
| `<config>/halted` | Machine, device-bound | the kill switch's marker (ADR 0071): an empty file whose existence means every agent purlis started on this machine is stopped | `halt::stop`, from the window's Stop all and `purlis stop --all`; only the window's re-arm removes it |
| `<config>/kill-switch.jsonl` | Machine, device-bound | the kill switch's journal (ADR 0071): one line per stop, re-arm or tamper, the newest 1000. On a runner, `by` may also be `link`: a stop or re-arm sent from a paired desktop (**decided, not yet written**, ADR 0078) | `halt.rs`, from the app and `purlis stop --all` |
| `<config>/restarted-to-update` | Machine, device-bound, transient | an empty file: the last quit was **Restart to update** | `reopen::mark_restart_to_update`; the next launch removes it |
| `<config>/runs/journal.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0068, ADR 0076; its contents pre-empt FD-29). The run journal: each live run's chat and run ids, its state with its reason or hold, the state a paused run was paused from, its conversation, harness and level; a run hibernated by a quit stays in it. Replaced whole at every move; read at the host's start to account for a crash. Kept out of `<config>/charterd/`, which is transient. Chats are denied it. Backed up by FR-10 | `purlisd`, its only writer (FD-29) |
| `<config>/charterd/<scope>` | Machine, device-bound, transient | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0068, ADR 0069, ADR 0081). One credential per human client scope (`local-ui`, `terminal`, `fleet-mcp`, `approval` and `editor`), minted fresh at each start of `purlisd`, so a crash or an upgrade rotates them. Chats are denied the directory | `purlisd` (FD-6, FD-27) |
| `<config>/extensions.json` | Machine, device-bound | each installed extension: its absolute path, the fingerprint the operator approved, and whether it is on; for a runner provider, also whether the operator marked its machines as the user's own (**decided, not yet written**, ADR 0089; default not owned, changed only on `local-ui`, never by the provider's own claim) | `extension::install`, `approve`, `set_on`, `forget` |
| `<config>/forge-etags/native-<account>/<sha256>.json` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | the native forge transport's ETag store (ADR 0070 §3, FW-2a): per forge account (`<kind>-<host>-<login>`), one file per request path and query, named by its SHA-256, holding the answer's ETag, its `Link` header and its body, so that a `304 Not Modified` is answered from here. Never a credential. **A chat is denied it, to read and to write**: its sandbox denies the directory under ADR 0067's human-powers class (`sandbox::Denied`), and in purlis only the native transport reads or writes it, which only a human in the window resolves to. A CLI call never shares an entry with it. Separate from FW-7's item cache; deleting it costs one full answer per request | `forge::etag::EtagDir`, from `forge::http::Http` |
| `<config>/forge-budget/<account>.json` | Machine, device-bound, transient | the request budget per forge account (FI14, FW-4): this hour's start, the requests sent as the account, those its forge counts, the `304`s, the background requests held back, and the forge's last stated limits. Never a request, an answer or a credential. Written by the process that sends (`forge::budget::Meter`), read by `purlis doctor`'s `forge budget` rows; a chat cannot write it (the machine store is denied to a chat's writes). Deleting it starts a fresh hour | `forge::budget::Meter` |
| `<config>/network-log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` | Machine, device-bound | the network log (OB-15, X50, ADR 0083 §9): one JSON line per forge call, `purlis report` filing and updater read purlis made on this machine, a file a UTC day, the newest 30 kept, so it is retained rather than transient and FR-10 may back it up. A line holds the time, the feature (`forge`, `updater`, `report`), the route (`https`, `gh`, `glab`), the host, the method, the path as a template (no query; the names after `repos`, `orgs` and the like, and everything after `branches`, `contents` and the like, shown as `{}`, and any other segment that is not a word of a forge's API too), the status or that no answer came, the time it took, and whether it went to purlis or to a third party. **Never** a body, a header value or token, a query, a name from a path, the account, or a chat's content. A purlis line keeps its path whole, because purlis's addresses are public. Nothing sends it anywhere and nothing reads it but a person (`netlog::entries`). A sandboxed chat's own process cannot write it, as it cannot write anything under `<config>` | `purlis_core::netlog`, from the forge transports, `purlis report` and the app's updater |
| `<config>/local-project-move`, `<config>/local-project-move.lock` | Machine, device-bound, transient | the journal of a move of the local project out of the config home (#1670): the moved folder's device and inode, written before the rename and removed once the link at the old place is gone, so a launch that stopped halfway is finished by the next one for that same folder only; and the `flock` one launch holds for the whole move. A chat cannot write either (the config home is denied to a chat's writes) | `localproject::run` |
| `<config>/plugin/` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | the copy of the bundled plugin that chats started outside the app load (ADR 0057). Its hooks name this binary by absolute path | `plugin_install`, refreshed at launch |
| `<data>/local-project/` | Plane | the **local project** the first run makes on a machine that has none (FR-4, #603), so nobody is asked where it goes. In the data home and never the config home, which a chat's sandbox denies whole, so a sandboxed chat starts in it (#1670). A machine whose local project is still at the old place, `<config>/local-plane/`, has it moved here at the app's next launch: one rename, a link left at the old place until the clones' worktree links, the record of open chats and the remembered projects name the new one, then the link taken away. A journal beside the machine store, `<config>/local-project-move`, holds the moved folder's device and inode from before the rename until the link is gone, so a launch that stopped between the rename and the link is finished by the next one, for that same folder only. One something works in, or whose new place is taken, is left where it is, and the app's log and the doctor say so (`localproject`). A Claude Code conversation of a chat that ran in the old place is not found by Resume in the new one (Claude Code keys its conversations by the folder); its file is left where the harness wrote it, and the chat starts fresh with its session record. An ordinary plane in every respect this document records — its own `charter.toml`, its own git — opened through the same trust gate as any other; only its location is fixed. It has **no remote**, so the Plane tier's backup (the remote) does not exist for it until the operator shares it: **FR-10 must cover it** or it has no backup at all. A repo opened from the first run or from New project is cloned into its `workspaces/<name>/<name>/`, `<name>` being the repo's, with `-2`, `-3`… when a different repo already holds that name | `firstrun::ensure_local_plane`, `firstrun::take_in` (`crates/purlis-core/src/firstrun.rs`); the move, `localproject::at_launch` |
| `<app data>/shims/` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | the `PATH` shims that warn when a harness is started by hand in a shell tab (ADR 0062) | `shellguard`, rewritten at every launch |
| `<app data>/git-hooks/` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | the git hooks a harness chat's git runs through `core.hooksPath`: purlis's scan of a commit and of what a push sends, then the repository's own hook of each name (ADR 0074) | `githooks`, rewritten at every launch |
| `<app log>/panics.log` | Machine, device-bound, transient | panic records: thread, place, message, backtrace, version. `$CHARTER_PANIC_LOG` moves it | `app/src-tauri/src/panics.rs`; `purlis report` reads it |
| `<app log>/charter.<YYYY-MM-DD>.log` | Machine, device-bound, transient | the app's diagnostic log (#647): one line per thing the app or the core noticed and nobody asked to see, with its time, level and source, from purlis's own code at `info` and up and from its libraries at `warn` and up. A new file each day, the newest seven kept. An event that looks like it holds a credential or personal data (`secretshape::found`, `secretshape::leaks` per line, or a field named for a token or a secret) is replaced whole by a line naming its kind. The same messages, without time or level, also go to standard error. Not the audit and not telemetry (O1, ADR 0075): nothing reads it but a person. `$CHARTER_LOG_DIR` moves it | `purlis_core::applog`, installed first thing by the app |
| `<extension dir>/<state>/facts.json` | None | an extension's footer facts, written by the extension's own program wherever the operator installed it; purlis only reads it | the extension |
| keyring `purlis/<vault>/<8 hex>` (written now), or `charter/<vault>/<8 hex>` (still read during the rename window, #1261), account = the key | Keyring | a keyring vault's values. The random service name is recorded only in `.charter/vaults/<name>.keys.json` | `secrets::keyring` |
| keyring `purlis/@identity/<16 hex>` (written now), or `charter/@identity/<16 hex>` (still read during the rename window for a record without `base`, #1261), account = the variable's name | Keyring | a vault provider's identity, such as a 1Password service-account token | `secrets::identity` |
| `<config>/forge-accounts.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0077). Each forge account: its id (a ULID), kind, host, login, how it was signed in (`device`, `pkce`, `pat` or `import`), the client id of a registration made on a host purlis has none compiled in for, whether it is signed in and the scopes last read; and each repo's or owner's binding to one account. Nothing secret. Device-bound because each entry points into this machine's keyring. Backed up by FR-10 and restored only onto a machine that replaces the old one (ADR 0069 §5), with every account signed out, since no token is backed up | the process holding the human scope: the window, then `purlisd` on `local-ui` (FW-3a, FW-3b) |
| keyring `charter/@forge/<host>/<id>`, `<id>` = the forge account's id | Keyring | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0070, ADR 0077). A forge account's token: the access token, and the refresh token and expiry where the flow gives them. The human's; only a `local-ui` caller reads or refreshes it, and a chat's sandbox denies it. The `@` keeps it apart from any vault's items | FW-3a, FW-3b |
| `<data>/events/<device>/events.jsonl` | Machine, device-bound | the host's event log (FD-9, ADR 0066, ADR 0068): one JSON line per event in ADR 0066's envelope (`v`, `device_id`, `seq`, `ulid`, `chat`, `run`, `parent_run`, `kind`, `body`), `seq` from 1 and never reused, one writer per device holding a lock on `events.lock` beside it. This file is the segment being written; at 16 MiB it is sealed as `events.<first seq>.jsonl` and a new one begun. A line a crash tore is cut off when the log is next opened, and a file with lines but no readable `seq` is refused rather than counted from 1 again. Kinds written today: `run.started` (body `cause`: `start`, `clear`, `reopen` for a chat a relaunch put back in its conversation, `fresh` for one started again without it, or `child` for a sub-agent's run, whose `parent_run` is the run that was current; `wake` and `switch` are named and not yet written), `run.ended` for a sub-agent's child run (ADR 0076 §6; body `state` and `cause`, under the child run with its `parent_run`): `completed` `child-ended` at its own `SubagentStop`, and otherwise with its parent's run, `completed` `superseded` at a `/clear` or a new run of the chat, `completed` `exited` at a `SessionEnd` for good, or the end state and cause the host gives for the parent's end (a chat's own runs have no `run.ended` yet), `hook.<word>` for every state hook (`sessionstart` adds `started`), `hook.<word>` for every tool hook purlis answers, `hook.commit_refused` for each commit purlis's git hook refused (no text, only the chat), `trust.sandbox.grant` and `trust.sandbox.revoke` (#1342, ADR 0067 as amended 2026-10-06) for each sandbox grant a person made or took back — `actor_kind` `human`, `actor` `operator`, `scope` `local-ui`, the `level` (`chat`, `you`, `project`), `what` (`host` or `write`) and the `target` host or folder — under the chat it came from, or no chat for a revoke from Settings, made durable before the grant takes effect, `trust.dispatch.grant` and `trust.dispatch.revoke` (#1437) for each dispatch grant a person made or took back — `actor_kind` `human`, `actor` `operator`, `scope` `local-ui`, the `level` (`chat`, `you`, `project`), the `asking` persona (null for a chat on no persona) and the `target` persona — under the asking chat for a grant made on its tab, with no chat for a revoke or for a committed pair allowed on the project's Notice (`level` `project`), made durable before the grant is in force; a grant that then could not be written is followed by its `revoke`; a grant or revoke of "any persona" (#1503) is the same two kinds with `target` `"*"`, `level` `you` or `project`, and no chat; every `trust.dispatch.*` body also has `workspace` (#1505): the workspace the grant is limited to, or null for one that holds in any workspace (for `level` `chat`, the workspace the task it was allowed for works in, null at the project's root; always null for a never, which is not limited), and a change of a grant's workspace in Settings is a `trust.dispatch.revoke` with the workspace it had followed by a `trust.dispatch.grant` with the one it has (where a project grant's change is in the committed file and this machine could not record that it follows it, the log ends there, on the grant the file holds, and nothing is recorded as put back); `trust.dispatch.once` (#1505) for one dispatch a person allowed that kept no grant, because the workspace its task works in was not there yet: the same body, `workspace` that name and `level` the answer pressed, under the asking chat, `trust.dispatch.decline` (#1504) for each grant of the project's a person said **Not on my machine** to in Settings — the same body, `level` always `project`, `target` `"*"` for "any persona", no chat, and the committed file unchanged; accepting one is a `trust.dispatch.grant` at `project`; `trust.dispatch.give_back` (#1504) for the person's one acknowledgement that the persona of a name today may have what an earlier persona of that name had, `asking` and `target` both that name, followed by a `trust.dispatch.grant` for each grant it put back in force; a grant purlis set aside itself, because a name in it came to be another persona's, is a `trust.dispatch.revoke` whose `actor_kind` is `host`, `actor` `purlis` and `scope` `persona-changed-hands`, never a person's — `trust.dispatch.never` and `trust.dispatch.never.lift` (#1503) for each never a person said for a pair and each one they lifted (`app/dispatch-never.json`) — the same body, `level` always `you` — under the asking chat for one said on its tab and with no chat for a lift, made durable before it is in force; a never that then could not be written is followed by its `lift`, a grant or a never the person made on a dispatch refused while nobody was there (#1507, `app/dispatches/refused-while-away.json`) is the same event with no chat, whose body also carries `from` `"away"`, so it is told from one made in Settings, `trust.sandbox.off` and `trust.sandbox.on` (ADR 0067 §7, ADR 0075 §4) under the run a start just began and before its program runs — `off` for a chat in a sandboxed project that starts without the sandbox (`actor_kind` `human`, `actor` `operator`, `scope` `local-ui` for a person's opt-out from the picker, or from a sandbox block's Notice that purlis grants nothing for, "Start without the sandbox for this chat", whose `reason` says so (#1342); `actor_kind` `host`, `actor` `purlis (no backend on this OS)` and `os` for a system with no backend, ruling V78 b), with `harness`, `persona`, the `reason` typed (one line, at most 200 characters, or null) and the classes `lifted`; `on` (`actor_kind` `host`, `actor` `purlis`, `harness`, `persona`, `restored`) for a chat whose last run was unsandboxed starting sandboxed — and `hook.unknown` (with the `word`, shortened) for a tool hook word it does not. A tool event has `tool`, `call`, `args` (the HMAC of the arguments' SHA-256, never the arguments), `decision` (`allow`, `ask`, `deny` or `none`), `rule` for a denial (`guard-crashed`, `guard-unanswered` and `unknown-hook` among them), `hook_ms`, and `tool_ms` on whichever of a call's pre and post hooks is heard second, within the hour, by the hooks' own clocks. Lines are written in the order their hooks connected, best effort: ordered unless recording a line takes longer than 50 ms. Chat and run ids are ULIDs. A chat's id is the one `app/reopen.json` keeps for it, so it is the same across a relaunch, and the host writes a chat's `run.started` as it starts the chat, before its program can send a line; a chat the host was never told of is given ids at its first line. Each event is `fsync`ed (the operating system's ordinary `fsync`; on macOS not `F_FULLFSYNC`) before the host tells the hook its line is taken, and the hook answers its harness only after that or after spooling the line (FD-30, `app/spool/`). What a drain of the hook spool finds is recorded at the project's open: each line that checked as it would have been live, with `spooled` its number, under the chat and run the reopen record names (with no chat or run, and `chat_number`, for a chat it does not), `hook.spool.gap` (`from`, `to`), `hook.spool.rejected` (`seq`, `why`: `unreadable`, `no-key`, `another-chats-key`, `mac`, `not-this-chats`, `repeated` or `unfinished`) and `hook.spool.drained` (`from`, `to`), each with `chat_number`. A line the host took after the hook stopped waiting and that was spooled too is recorded twice. Never committed and never sent. The audit (ADR 0075) and OTel logs (ADR 0083) are written from it. Retention (FD-24): every event of the last 30 days is kept, and more; a sealed segment is deleted, when the log is opened or a segment sealed, once its newest event is older than that, and the segment being written and the newest sealed one never are. A client reads it with `subscribe(since)` from the last `seq` it holds and gets every later event in order and once, across segments and across a host killed and started again; a cursor older than what is kept, or one that falls in a segment no longer kept, gets a `missed` marker and carries on from the next event kept. A cursor ahead of the log's last event (a power loss took lines the client had read, and the next host numbers from there again) gets an `ahead` marker once, with the log's last `seq`, and carries on from it, so every event written after reaches the client. Backed up by FR-10 (ADR 0069 row 63) | `purlis_core::eventlog::Recorder`, held by the app, its only writer; the app's doctor has an `event log` row |
| `<data>/network/<project key>.jsonl` | Machine, device-bound | this machine's network record (#1662, spec #1661): one JSON line per event, appended, oldest first, for the project whose key names the file (the digest the sandbox's cache homes are named by). `{"at": <seconds since 1970>, "event": "block"\|"allow"\|"remove"\|"ask"\|"timeout"\|"connect", "outcome": "refused"\|"allowed"\|"removed"\|"held"}`, and as the event has them: `block` (`{"operation", "kind", "ours"}`, the words of the sandbox block a chat's hook reported), `what` (`host`, `write`, `vault` or `persona-hosts`, for an Allow or a removal; `persona-hosts` at `chat` is a chat taking its own persona's grants, #1681), `target` (for a Block, the host and port a refused connection was to, which its Notice offered to allow; for an Allow, what it names; never a refused path), `looked_up` (for a Block of a refused lookup only, the host the program said it looked up: a program's own printed words named it, so it is shown as text and **never offered to allow**; #1663), `chat` (`{"id", "name", "session"}`: the chat's id, the name it was shown under and its number then), `persona`, `scope` (`chat`, `you` for this project on this machine, `project` for everyone in it) and `who` (`you`, the person at this machine). `ask` (`outcome` `held`) is a connection purlis's proxy held while it asked the person, and `timeout` (`outcome` `refused`) one nobody answered in time (#1666); each has `target`, `chat`, `persona` and `times`. A `block` line with `times` (#1681) counts the repeats of the block before it that the app's throttle held back within its minute, written once that minute is over, or sooner when its chat's turn ends, the chat ends or the project is let go of: it stands for `times` blocks, and a build that does not know it counts it as one. A `connect` line (#1664) is connections purlis's own proxy carried or refused for a chat it wraps: `target`, `scope` as the decision (`open`, `persona`, `you`, `chat`, or `project` for everyone in the project's Allow taken live by a running chat, with `outcome` `allowed`; `ask` or `refused` with `outcome` `refused`) and `times`, how many connections it stands for; the proxy coalesces them to a line per host and port a minute (`sandbox::egress::Tally`), written within a few seconds of the minute's end (#1699), and one with no `target` stands for the hosts past what it tells apart. A Block's `target` and `looked_up` are kept only once they pass the check a grant makes of a host (no wildcard, no loopback, link-local or metadata address, no single-label name), in that check's canonical form; a build that does not know `looked_up` reads the line without it. No command, argument, output or refused path. A line older than 30 days, and any past 5000, is let go of when the next is written, by rewriting the file whole under a lock on the folder; a line this build cannot read is kept and passed over. `0600`. Never in a project, never committed, never sent. Settings' Network page (Open hosts, Allowed, Blocked lately), a chat's Network view and `purlis doctor`'s `sandbox blocks` row read it; nothing decides what a chat may reach from it. Deleting it empties those lists and the doctor's count, and nothing else | the app, its only writer (`purlis_core::sandboxblock::record::Record`): each block it takes after `sandboxblock::Throttle`, from a chat's hook or from purlis's own proxy beside a Codex or opencode chat (#1663), each Allow and removal after its audit, and each `connect` line a chat's proxy tells it |

Backed up by FR-10 with the log | `purlis_core::eventlog::Log`, which seals and deletes them; `eventlog::read` and `eventlog::subscribe` read them |
| `<data>/events/<device>/events.lock` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | empty; the event log's one writer holds a lock on it for as long as it writes, so a second host is refused (ADR 0068). A file of its own so the lock outlives each sealed segment | `purlis_core::eventlog::Log` |
| `<data>/events/<device>/args.key` | Machine, device-bound | 32 random bytes, `0600`, that key the event log's args digests, so a digest of `ls -la` cannot be matched by anyone who lacks the key and stays comparable from one launch to the next. Anything running as the same OS user can read it, and so can whoever holds a backup that carries it; the key protects the digests from everyone else. The hook sends the host the arguments' *unkeyed* SHA-256 on the chat's hook channel, which only the same user can reach.

| `<data>/audit/<device>/<first>-<last>.jsonl.zst` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0075).

| `<data>/audit/retention.json` | Machine, syncable | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0075). The audit's retention and disk cap (defaults one year and 2 GiB); every change is itself an audit entry | `purlisd`, from the viewer's setting (AU-8) |
| `<data>/index/` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0079). The machine's search index over the transcript archive (KN-31) only: `current`, naming the live generation, and one directory per generation holding `search.sqlite` (WAL, FTS5 contentless at `detail=full`: terms with their positions and row metadata, no text as written; a span the shape scanner flags is indexed as its kind). Each row carries its chat, run, turn and the `<clone-key>` of the clone the chat ran in, which the host filters a chat's search on. Rows stop answering when the archive drops their chat, and leave the file at the `optimize` and checkpoint that follow every erasure. Chats are denied it.

One file per review of a branch: the operator's review draft (each comment's path, side, line or range, the commit it was written against and the operator's text; never code), the *Viewed* ticks, the last reviewed head, where the operator was, and the comments already sent. A review is named by project, workspace, repo and branch, never by an absolute path. Chats are denied it, reading and writing. Backed up by FR-10 | the window (RC-7) |
| keyring item for a human's audit pseudonym key | Keyring | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0075). One key per human principal on this device, which turns that person's principal into the pseudonyms the audit stores. Deleting it is erasure. Its item name is AU-18's | AU-18 |
| keyring item for the device key | Keyring | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0066, ADR 0075). The key that signs this device's audit chain; on a headless host, an age-encrypted file stands in for it. Its item name is AU-3's | AU-3 |
| `<config>/runners.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0078). The runners this machine uses: each one's name, connector (an argument vector, never a shell string), preset, provider if any, its role label (`harness`, `app` or `browser`) and tags (ADR 0089), the runner's device id and its pinned public link key. Written only from a human scope, and denied to chats. A project names a runner and never defines one | `purlis runner add` and `remove`, and the window (RR-1) |
| `<config>/peers.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0078). On a runner: the devices paired with it, each one's device id, pinned public link key and when it was paired. Its host refuses a link from any other key. Denied to chats | the runner's `purlisd`, at pairing; `purlis runner peers` (RR-1) |

Denied to chats | the runner's `purlisd` (RR-16) |
| keyring item for the link key | Keyring | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0078). This device's static X25519 key for the Noise `XX` handshake of a runner link, apart from the device key. On a headless runner the link key is held in the same age-encrypted form as the device key. Denied to chats | `purlis runner add`, or the runner's `purlisd` at pairing (RR-1) |

One short-lived runner's record, made by a provider for a human or a chat: its id, role label, tags, provider and the provider's handle for the machine, its owner (a chat and run for an agent-started runner, or the workspace for one a human started or pinned), workspace and source ref, its pinned device id and public link key, its forwarded ports and public URLs with their expiries, its state, and its runner-hours and spend so far. Read at every start of `purlisd` to stop or destroy orphans. Denied to chats. Backed up by FR-10, so a restore onto a replacing machine can stop what still runs or bills | the desktop's `purlisd`, its only writer (RR-29) |
| `<config>/runner-grants.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0089). Per project and workspace, each **grant**: the repo and spec path that declared it, the vault and entry it approves, its test credential if any, the commits the operator approved for it (a grant reaches only a runner building a ref a human chose), and when and by whom. Never a value. Written only on `local-ui` or by `purlis` on that scope; a chat cannot add, widen or read it. Device-bound because each grant points into this machine's vaults; a restore marks a grant whose entry is missing. Backed up by FR-10 | the window and `purlis runner grant` (RR-33) |
| `<config>/runner-budgets.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0089). Per project and workspace, the runner budget agents start runners within, which counts and stops only agent-started runners: concurrent agent-started runners, runner-hours a day, spend a month for a provider that reports cost (zero until a human sets it), the idle timeout, and the period's usage. Written only on `local-ui` (the window, or `purlis` on that scope); denied to chats. Backed up by FR-10 | the window and `purlis runner budget` (RR-31) |
| runner images and stopped containers | None | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0089). The images the core provider builds from a devcontainer spec with the verified `purlis` in a layer of its own, and the containers of runners not yet destroyed. They are the container engine's, in its own store; purlis names them by runner id and prunes them, and owns no file there | the core Docker and Podman provider (RR-3) |
| `<data>/telemetry/` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0083). The telemetry store: OTel records from the harnesses, purlis's own spans, the host's counters and logs derived from the event log, after people and gated content are removed; rolling segments and an index the views read. 30 days and 1 GiB by default, oldest segment deleted first. Never the audit. Not backed up, as a named exception to ADR 0069 §2: losing it costs past charts. Denied to chats (ADR 0067 §5 class 2) | `purlisd`'s telemetry receiver, its only writer (OB-2) |
| `<data>/telemetry/cursors.json` | Machine, device-bound, rebuildable | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0083). Each export destination's place in the telemetry store; a lost cursor restarts that destination at the oldest record | `purlisd` (OB-9) |
| `<config>/telemetry.json` | Machine, device-bound | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0083). Whether telemetry is collected, its retention and cap, each project's open content gates, and the export destinations: each one's name, OTLP/HTTP URL, signals and a pointer to its auth header in the keyring. No project file opens a gate or names a destination. Device-bound because of those pointers and consents. Denied to chats (ADR 0067 §5 class 2). Backed up by FR-10 | a `local-ui` caller only (the window, or `purlis` on that scope), through `purlisd` (OB-2, OB-9) |
| keyring item for a telemetry export destination's auth header | Keyring | **decided, not yet written** (ADR 0083). The header value an export destination sends, such as a backend's API key. Denied to chats | OB-9 |

### Environment variables that move or key this state

| Variable | Effect | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `CHARTER_HOME` | **In the Python charter, replaces the state directory outright**: every file in this section moves, verbatim, with no migration. **In purlis only part of it moves** ([#750](https://github.com/purlis/purlis/issues/750)). The local vault registry, `vaults/`, `fingerprint.key`, the push and save journals, the gate files (`sessions/<sid>.tools`, `.gate`, `commit-gate/`), `sessions/<sid>.memnudge`, `dispatch-inflight/`, `ws-edit-nudge/`, `agent-personas.json`, `mcp-approved.json` and `unrecorded/` move, because their writers call `plane::state_dir`. The session and terminal pointers, `active-persona`, `sessions/<sid>.usage`, `sessions/<chat>.saved`, `persona-state/`, `handbacks/`, `cache/glstate.json`, `harness-profiles-launched.json`, `app/` and `workspace-rename.json` stay in `<plane>/.charter`, because their writers join `.charter` to the root themselves. **Decided, not yet written** (ADR 0079): the project's search index, `index/<clone-key>/`, moves with the state directory (V22b), keyed by clone so that clones sharing one directory never share an index | `charter/config.py:42`, `charter/config.py:110`; `crates/purlis-core/src/plane.rs` (`state_dir`) |
| `CHARTER_ROOT` | Picks the plane (hence `<root>/.charter`); a bad value raises rather than falling back | `charter/root.py:20` |
| `CHARTER_SESSION_ID` | Names `sessions/<sid>.*`, `commit-gate/<sid>`, `ws-edit-nudge/<sid>-…`, the trace bucket, and inside a frame it is the **chat id** that names `frame/<chat>/` and `chat-turns/<chat>` | `charter/session.py:65`, shadowing explained `charter/session.py:46` |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` | Fallback for the above | `charter/session.py:66` |
| `TERM_SESSION_ID` / `TMUX_PANE` / `STY` / `SSH_TTY` (then `ttyname`) | Name `terminals/<tid>.*` | `charter/session.py:75`–`:79`, `charter/session.py:111` |
| `CHARTER_WORKSPACE` | Overrides the resolved workspace **without writing anything**; also the `identity` pin read per chat. **purlis sets it on every chat it starts in a workspace** (SI-1), and never lets a chat inherit the app's own | `charter/workspace.py:550`, `charter/frame/state.py:1616`; `crates/purlis-core/src/start.rs` |
| `CHARTER_PLANE_ROOT_SESSION` | **purlis only** (SI-1). `1` on a chat the app started at the plane root — the plane's own directory or anywhere under it that is no workspace's (SI-1b) — so the session is in no workspace (see the workspace resolution order). Any other value is ignored. A variable of its own rather than a value of `CHARTER_WORKSPACE`, so nothing that reads that one as a name ever sees it; set by the app, never inherited, and refused in a profile's `env` like every `CHARTER_` name | `crates/purlis-core/src/active.rs` (`PLANE_ROOT_ENV`, `at_plane_root`) |
| `CHARTER_PERSONA` | Same, for personas | `charter/persona.py:1260` |
| `CHARTER_HARNESS` | Which harness the registry reports; stored per chat in `frame/<chat>/identity` | `charter/harness/registry.py:46`, `charter/commands_frame.py:3058` |
| `CHARTER_WORKTREES` | Moves worktrees (not state) | `charter/config.py:82` |
| `CHARTER_NO_BACKGROUND_CHECKS` | Suppresses the spawners that write `cache/glstate.*` and `cache/update.*` | `charter/util.py:382`, gates at `charter/glstate.py:209`, `charter/update.py:491` |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Recorded into `guard-seen.json` | `charter/guardseen.py:62` |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Decides `guard-seen.json`'s `source` field (`plugin` vs `settings`) | `charter/guardseen.py:55` |
| `CLAUDE_PID` | Adopting a harness pid into `frame/<chat>/harness.pid` | `charter/hooks.py:6084` |
| `CHARTER_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Move `reporting-consent` | `charter/report.py:462` |
| `CHARTER_DATA_HOME` / `XDG_DATA_HOME` | Move `<data>`, purlis's data home: the event log in it today (FD-9), and the audit once it is written (ADR 0075). A value under a plane or inside a git work tree is refused | ADR 0075, `crates/purlis-core/src/datahome.rs` |
| `EDM_HOME` / `EDM_WORKSPACE` / `EDM_PERSONA` | Legacy names, warned about only | `charter/legacyenv.py:39` |

### What the tmux frame and the status line read that a **hook** wrote

One process writes each of these and a different one reads it, which is what makes them
stable to purlis. It is also the shape of the problem the app has: Python's hooks keep
writing a session's state, and the app has to learn the same facts. It does **not** inherit
this surface file by file — `frame/` is the tmux frame's own (the ruling above) — so where a
row below names a `frame/<chat>/` file, the app needs its own answer to the same question,
and the row says what that question is.

| Written by (Python hook) | File | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `sessionstart` → `toolgate.snapshot` (`charter/hooks.py:7620`) | `sessions/<sid>.tools`, `sessions/<sid>.gate` | the PreToolUse guard, `purlis persona` |
| `sessionstart` → `_record_harness_session` (`charter/hooks.py:6102`) | `frame/<chat>/session`, `session.durable`, `session.adopted`, `harness.pid`, `conversation` | frame panels, `purlis reopen`, tab menu |
| every hook → `notify.plane_changed` (`charter/frame/notify.py:132`) | `frame/<chat>/version` **and** `frame/<chat>/gather.json` | `charter/frame/panel.py:802` (the repaint loop) |
| `_turn_begin`/`_turn_bump` (`charter/hooks.py:5971`, `:6177`) | `chat-turns/<chat>` (mtime) | `charter/frame/panel.py:657`, `charter/frame/slots.py:5060` |
| `pretooluse-dispatch` (`charter/hooks.py:7954`) | `dispatch-inflight/*.json` | `charter/statusline.py:1834`, `charter/frame/panel.py:580` |
| the guard (`charter/hooks.py:6222`) | `guard-seen.json` | `charter/doctor.py:2002` |
| `charter statusline` (fed the harness payload) | `sessions/<sid>.usage` | `charter/statusline.py:735` → frame panels (the `ctx %` exists nowhere else) |
| `purlis ws use` in the chat's shell | `sessions/<sid>.workspace`, `sessions/<sid>.lock` | every purlis process in that chat |

Two of these are *not* keyed the same way: `.usage` is keyed on **Claude Code's** session id
out of the payload, while everything frame-side is keyed on the **chat id**
(`$CHARTER_SESSION_ID`). A chat's context gauge therefore needs a
chat → harness-session mapping; `frame/<chat>/session` is where the tmux frame keeps its
copy, and an app that does not read `frame/` needs one of its own.

## Appendix: what this survey found in the code

Recording the format meant reading every writer and reader. These are the things
that surprised the survey: stale docs, latent divergences, and writes that are not
atomic where their neighbours are. **Nothing here was fixed** — the Python charter is
frozen (spec decision 16), and a rebuild has to reproduce the behaviour as it is, not
as it was meant to be. They are recorded so the rebuild copies them deliberately and
so each one can be filed on its own merits.

### In the plane root

1. **`[harness] default` has two readers with two vocabularies.**
   `instance.harness_of` accepts only a registry `cli_name` and records anything else as
   `refused` (`charter/instance.py:3088`), while `profiles.derive` treats the same key as
   naming *any* profile, including one only `charter.local.toml` declares
   (`charter/profiles.py:318`). `doctor` papers over it by checking the refused value against
   the profile set (`charter/doctor.py:390`). `docs/control-plane.md:96` documents it as
   "which row bare `purlis`'s profile selector starts on" and lists only the three harness
   words. A Rust reader has to implement both readings. Flagged as **stable** either way.
2. **`workspaces/.gitkeep` is ignored-negated and anchored on, but never created** by `init`
   or `reinit` (measured). Whether the app should create it is a question for the workspaces
   area; the anchor line matters to `.gitignore` splicing either way. *purlis creates
   it (#355).*
3. **`charter.toml` is rewritten non-atomically** (`p.write_text`, `charter/instance.py:441`)
   with no lock, while every `.charter/` writer goes through `config.replace_for`. Two
   concurrent `persona default` / `version bump` runs can interleave. Marked stable; noting the
   write discipline because a second implementation writing the same file needs to know
   purlis does *not* hold a lock. *purlis replaces it by rename under a lock (#357).*
4. **`.charter/harness-profiles-launched.json` is read-modify-written whole with no lock**
   (`charter/profiletrust.py:172`). Its own module documents that it is not a boundary
   (`charter/profiletrust.py:18`). Marked **stable** because a second process reads it and
   it gates command execution — confirm that is the classification the doc wants for a
   `.charter/` file.
5. **`instance.SCHEMA` vs `workspace.STRUCTURE_VERSION`** are deliberately never compared
   (`charter/instance.py:33`). Only the plane number refuses. Worth stating in the assembled
   doc so a Rust reader does not gate on the workspace number.
6. **`[[forge]] version`** appears in a code comment as an example of a key `_set_key` must not
   clobber (`charter/instance.py:398`), but no forge code reads a `version` key. It is an
   example, not a setting, and the survey found no reader for it.
7. **`config.GROUP`/`EXCLUDE` are "the first `[[forge]]` block's"** (`charter/config.py:728`,
   `charter/instance.py:148`) while `discover` asks per block (`charter/commands.py:120`). Two
   meanings of one word in one file; both are live.
8. **The empty-inventory skeleton has no `note` key** (`charter/inventory.py:74`) while the
   saved document always does (`charter/inventory.py:308`). A strict reader must treat `note`
   as optional.
9. **`purlis docs` exits 1 on an empty inventory** (`charter/commands.py:220`) and also
   exits 1 when the README roster could not be refreshed (`charter/commands.py:231`) even
   though `docs/topology.md` was written. Not a config-format issue, but it affects any
   fixture generator that checks exit codes.

### In workspaces

1. **`change.record_landing` has no caller in `charter/`.** `charter/change.py:156` is a
   complete landing-log writer (`config.open_for`, `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`), and the
   suite calls it (`tests/_changerepo.py:122`, `tests/test_change_surface.py:573`) but the
   product does not: the only caller of the landing log is `commands_change._append_landing`
   (`charter/commands_change.py:1092`, called at `charter/commands_change.py:1501`), which
   uses `contain.json_line` and a raw `os.open(..., 0o644)`. The two agree on the line's
   fields and key order but differ in escaping (`ensure_ascii=True` only in the live one)
   and in file mode dispatch. A Rust writer should follow `_append_landing` — and deleting
   `record_landing` as dead would take the behaviour those tests pin with it. Flagged, not
   fixed.
2. **The brief says `refs/` holds `README.md` and `repos.json`.** There is no `repos.json`
   under a workspace's `refs/`. `repos.json` is `inventory/repos.json`
   (`charter/config.py:783`). `refs/` holds the generated `README.md` and whatever the
   operator drops in.
3. **`.charter-generated` is stable**, although only purlis reads it: a *different
   process* (a later launch, `doctor`, `reinit`) does, and deleting it is not harmless —
   every generated file then reads as `foreign` and is never refreshed or withdrawn again.
4. **`.charter/workspace-tab-order` and `workspace-arrivals/` are stable**, and the survey
   first had them as internal because they are regenerated at the next launch
   (`charter/workspace.py:1066`, `charter/workspace.py:1229`). Every frame process on the
   plane reads them, which is what the rule turns on; the regeneration is what deleting one
   costs, and the entries say so.
5. **Two different manifest orderings.** A manifest purlis creates has
   `name, description, repos, updated_at, updated_by, charter_generated`; one written by
   `snapshot`/`fork` keeps whatever order the document on disk had and appends new keys
   (`fork` inserts `forked_from`). A byte-identical Rust writer has to preserve the order it
   read rather than impose a canonical one. `charter_generated` is always last because it is
   assigned after the copy (`charter/workspace.py:1611`).
6. **`updated_by` has two sources** — `$USER` for automatic writes and `git config user.name`
   for `snapshot`/`fork` — so the same workspace's manifest can alternate between two
   spellings of the same person. Intentional per `charter/workspace.py:1620`, but worth
   recording in the spec.
7. **Local vs UTC time in one store.** A memory's filename prefix is local time and its body
   stamp is local; every other timestamp in the area is UTC. `memstore.memory_date` reads the
   body first and the filename second (`charter/memstore.py:150`), so the two must agree —
   they do only because both come from the same local `now`.
8. **`charter_generated` digest input uses Python's default JSON separators.** A Rust
   implementation emitting `{"a":1}` instead of `{"a": 1}` produces a different digest and
   every manifest reads as the operator's. This is unwritten anywhere but in the code
   (`charter/workspace.py:1540`).
9. **`_live_block` and `_ws_meta_paths` are two lists of the same set** in two modules, held
   together only by `tests/test_todos_are_committed.py` (`charter/workspace.py:1390`,
   `charter/commands_workspace.py:1094`). A second implementation should derive both from
   one list.
10. **The LIVE block is written non-atomically** (`gi.write_text`,
    `charter/workspace.py:1418`) where every other committed file purlis writes goes through
    `config.replace_for`. A kill mid-write truncates the plane's `.gitignore`. *purlis
    replaces it by rename under a lock (#358).*
11. **Legacy migrations a Rust reader will meet:** `repos/` → `workspaces/`
    (`charter/workspace.py:53`) and `.edm-structure` → `.charter-structure`
    (`charter/workspace.py:4477`, `charter/workspace.py:4494`). Both are best-effort renames
    performed on read.
12. **`workspaces/.gitkeep` is an anchor that `purlis init` never creates.** The line
    `!/workspaces/.gitkeep` is written into `.gitignore` (`charter/commands.py:1091`) and is
    the literal insertion point for the LIVE block (`charter/workspace.py:1414`), but no
    command writes the file itself — measured on a fresh `purlis init`.

### In personas and memory

1. **`.charter/persona-state/trace/<session>.jsonl` — stable or internal?** Marked stable
   (written by hooks, read by `purlis trace`/`persona recall` in other processes), but it
   is machine-local, gitignored and losing it costs only history — but the status line
   reads it in another process, which is what the rule turns on.
2. **`.charter/sessions/<sid>.persona` / `terminals/<tid>.persona` / `active-persona`** —
   written by `persona.py`, but the directories belong to the workspaces area. Someone must
   decide which section owns them so they are not documented twice or dropped.
3. **`.charter/mcp-approved.json`** — written by `mcpseen.py`, but
   `persona.py` is its only consumer and it decides whether a generated agent carries the
   vault wrapper. Overlaps the secrets agent.
4. **`personas/_dispatch` vs `inflight`** — `charter/inflight.py` notes that `_dispatch`
   records a dispatch when it *finishes*; `.charter/dispatch-inflight/` is a separate
   (gitignored) store, documented in the `.charter/` section.
5. **Docs vs code — `persona-state/log/<name>.jsonl`.** `charter/persona.py:15` (module
   docstring) still advertises "an activity log (`log/<name>.jsonl`)"; there is none —
   `charter/persona.py:2458` says so, and activity lives in `trace/`. Docstring is stale.
6. **Docs vs code — frontmatter table.** `docs/personas.md:112`-`:123` lists only `role`,
   `vault`, `delegate-when`, `tools`, `agent-tools`, `extends`, `uses`, `activity`. The
   code reads eight more (`name`, `description`, `agent-description`, `disallowed-tools`,
   `skills`, `draft`, `dispatch-isolation`, plus `routing`/`routes-to`/`borrows`, which are
   documented in later sections) and passes through `model`, `color`, `memory`.
7. **Docs vs code — `purlis persona use` help.** `charter/cli.py:1658` says it "writes
   `.charter/active-persona`"; it writes that file only when there is neither a session id
   nor a terminal id (`charter/persona.py:1529`). In a normal session it writes the two
   pointers instead.
8. **Slug truncation can leave a trailing `-`.** `charter/memstore.py:26`-`:28` strips `-`
   *before* `[:48]`, so a 48-char cut mid-word keeps the hyphen: a memory titled
   "1097 is worse than the issue says: F2 detach ran the wrong command" is filed as
   `1097-is-worse-than-the-issue-says-f2-detach-ran-.md`. Harmless,
   but a byte-identical writer must reproduce it (not fixed here).
9. **No atomic writes anywhere in this area.** `persona.md`, `.claude/agents/<name>.md`,
   memory files and `MEMORY.md` are all plain `write_text`/`open`; the only concurrency
   defence is `O_APPEND` in the two jsonl stores and an flock around the dispatch *commit*
   (`charter/hooks.py:8206`). `MEMORY.md` is explicitly expected to drift and is reconciled
   by `index_drift` (`charter/memstore.py:217`).
10. **`_skills` rows are never committed by purlis**, unlike `_dispatch`
    (`charter/hooks.py:8189` has no skill equivalent), although both are committed paths. So
    on a `share = "push"` plane the skill tally lags behind the dispatch tally. Possibly
    deliberate, possibly an omission.
11. **`_render_agent` reads `meta.get("vault")` for the MCP wrapper (`charter/commands_persona.py:877`)
    but `persona.vault_of(name)` for the credential prose (`:1067`).** `mcp_render_entry`
    normalises `none` via `mcp_vault`, so behaviour is right; the two spellings are still a
    latent divergence if `vault:` is unset and a tagged vault exists (the MCP path would see
    no vault, the prose would see the tagged one).
12. **Front-door personas get `.gitkeep` but no `MEMORY.md`/`refs/README.md`**
    (`charter/commands.py:2678`-`:2680`) while `persona create` gets the opposite
    (`charter/persona.py:2265`). Two scaffolds for one layout — a reader (and `doctor`'s
    index check) sees two shapes.

### In the vaults and the harness wiring

1. **Two different JSON encodings for the two vault-file providers.** `plain-file` writes
   insertion order (`charter/secrets/plain_file.py:91`); `reference` writes `sort_keys=True`
   (`charter/secrets/reference.py:194`). Both are 0600 `.json` files under
   `.charter/vaults/` with the same naming rule, so a byte-identical writer must branch on
   the provider. Deliberate or accidental is not stated anywhere.
2. **The reference provider chmods after writing** (`charter/secrets/reference.py:194`-`195`
   — `write_text` then `os.chmod`), which is exactly the window
   `PlainFileProvider._write_private` was rewritten to close (#437,
   `charter/secrets/plain_file.py:42`). A reference file holds no value, but it is the same
   pattern the codebase documents as a defect. Not fixed here; flagged.
3. **`purlis secret set` never creates `fingerprint.key`; `purlis secret get` does.**
   Measured. Any fixture that wants the key must run a masking read.
4. **`_plugin_dispatches_guard` always asks about `~/.claude`** even under
   `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (`charter/commands.py:1230`), while `doctor` follows the
   variable. The code names this as a known divergence pending "per-profile wiring task 4".
   A second implementation must copy the asymmetry, not the variable.
5. **Whether `<plane>/opencode.json` should be marked stable-committed is decided by
   purlis's own output, not by `.gitignore`** — nothing ignores it and `guard` prints
   "These files are committed". Confirmed by reading `_GITIGNORE_BASELINE`; no explicit
   statement in code that it is *meant* to be committed.
6. **`~/.config/opencode/command/charter.md` is create-only** (`charter/harness/opencode.py:982`)
   while the shim and the context file are refreshed. A command file from an older purlis
   is never updated and nothing reports it stale — unlike the shim, which has `unvouched`.
   Possible gap; not fixed.
7. **`ensure_instructions` writes an absolute path into a machine-global config**
   (`charter/harness/opencode.py:682`). Moving `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` leaves a dead entry, and
   nothing prunes it. Flagged, not fixed.
8. **Marker values are `str | list[str]`** (`charter/workspace.py:2440`). A consumer that
   assumes `str` will mis-read a plane killed mid-write. Worth stating explicitly in the
   doc.
9. `.charter/cache/harness-wiring.json` is marked **internal**
   (one module writes and reads it, safe to delete). It is borderline — two *processes*
   (the selector and a later selector run) read it, and a chat can write it, which is why
   `cached()` re-validates every field. If the doc's rule is "another process reads it", it
   would make it stable; the front matter's cache ruling is why it is not.
10. `.charter/unrecorded/<hash>.json` — same borderline: written by one module, read by
    `doctor` in a *different* process (`charter/workspace.py:2984` `unrecorded_reason`). I
    marked it internal because it is a diagnostic that regenerates; a stricter reading of
    the rule makes it stable.

### In `.charter/`

1. **`docs/control-plane.md:868` disclaims any format stability for `.charter/frame/`**
   ("no format version and never will … may change shape in any release"). The survey
   raised this as a conflict with an app that reads plane files; the ruling in "How to read
   it" settles it the other way — the app replaces the tmux frame rather than reading its
   state, so the disclaimer stands untouched. Recorded because the next person to want a
   fact that lives only in `frame/` will meet it: that fact has to be promoted here first,
   and `control-plane.md` amended in the same change.
2. **Nothing guarantees the `sessions/` sweep runs.** `_prune` unlinks any file in
   `sessions/` and `terminals/` past 30 days, `.ask-pending` included
   (`charter/workspace.py:881`-`:889`) — the survey's first reading of this was wrong, and
   the leave-behind on a declined ask is deliberate and tested, not a leak
   (`charter/workspace.py:875`-`:879`, #290). What is true is that the sweep only runs from
   `set_active`, so a plane whose operator does not switch workspaces never sweeps: 80
   markers had accumulated on the plane this was written against.
3. **`ws-edit-nudge/<sid>-<ws>` keys are ambiguous.** The key is
   `re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z0-9._-]", "", f"{session}-{ws}")` (`charter/hooks.py:7652`) — session
   `a` + workspace `b-c` and session `a-b` + workspace `c` collide. Harmless (one nudge),
   but a Rust reimplementation must copy the *exact* derivation to stay compatible.
4. **`dispatch-inflight` files are written by `tempfile.mkstemp`, not through `config`**
   (`charter/inflight.py:244`), so they bypass `open_for`/`STATE_FILE_MODE`. They come out
   0600 anyway, but they are the one writer in this area outside the dispatch. Is that
   deliberate?
5. **`unrecorded/` uses `config.mkdir_for`, not `private_mkdir`** (`charter/workspace.py:2976`)
   — equivalent today (the path is under the state dir, so `mkdir_for` dispatches to
   private), but it is the only state writer relying on the dispatch rather than saying
   what it means.
6. **Is `active-workspace` dead?** `config.py:804` derives it and nothing in the package
   reads or writes it. If the app should ignore it, say so in the spec; if any older
   purlis still writes it, the app will see a file this doc calls dead.
7. **Where does `sessions/<sid>.persona` belong** — this area (it is a `sessions/` file) or
   the personas section, which documents them in full; the entries here are the
   `.charter/` view of the same files.
8. **`persona-state/trace/<sid>.jsonl` is read by the status line**
   (`charter/statusline.py:2078`) even though `persona-state/` is the personas section's.
   The "recorded ✎N" chip on the footer depends on it, so the app needs that file's format
   too — flagging the cross-area dependency.
9. **`cache/vaulthealth.json:detail` carries provider prose** that can include paths and
   account hints (visible in the live plane). If the app surfaces cache contents verbatim,
   that field needs the same handling as any vault-adjacent string.
10. **`frame/<chat>/brief` is written with no trailing-newline normalisation**
    (`charter/frame/state.py:2566`) while every sibling appends `\n`. A byte-identical
    writer must not "fix" it.
11. **Marker-file ordering is load-bearing in at least one place:** `.gate` must be touched
    *before* `.tools` (`charter/toolgate.py:808`). Any Rust writer that reorders them
    reopens #443. The survey did not enumerate every order dependency (the
    `session`/`session.durable`/`session.adopted` trio is the likely second one,
    `charter/frame/state.py:1023`).
12. **`frame/probe-1/` on the plane this was written against** is a `<prefix>-<pid>`-shaped
    frame id, not a chat id, and holds only `gather.json` + `version`. `frame_id()` gives
    the shape and `purlis frame-probe` (`charter/news.py:1052`, `cmd_probe` at
    `charter/commands_frame.py:599`) is where the name plausibly comes from, but no writer
    in this tree mints `probe-1` itself — most likely an older release left it. A reader
    enumerating `frame/` should expect directory names it cannot account for.
