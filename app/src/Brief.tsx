/**
 * **The brief a task was sent, read back** (#1494, V100-45).
 *
 * A task starts on a brief: what its asking chat wrote, or what the person wrote from a chat's
 * tab. **Brief** shows it as it was sent, with who sent it, when, to which persona and where
 * it works. It is on a task's row menu in the Chats list, on a finished task's row, and on the
 * breadcrumb line while a tab shows a task. All three open this one panel.
 *
 * **Read-only, and a dialog, not a view tab.** It asks nothing, so Escape, Close and a press
 * outside it all close it, and the keyboard goes back to where it was.
 *
 * **The brief is a chat's words, never purlis's, and never markup here.** It is one text node
 * in a `<pre>`: no link in it is live, no image is loaded, no tag is read. Where it holds a
 * character that draws as nothing or turns the words around it, the core hands it over written
 * out as well (`inert`), that is what is drawn, and the panel says so. **Copy gives the brief
 * as it was sent**, byte for byte. Where the brief was drawn written out there are two, by
 * name: **Copy as shown**, which is what was read, and **Copy as sent**.
 *
 * **Long briefs are whole**: the box scrolls, and nothing is cut by the panel. A brief the
 * record itself cut, and a record that holds none, are said in plain words.
