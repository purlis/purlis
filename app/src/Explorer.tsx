/**
 * The left region: the repo and worktree **explorer** (ADR 0038).
 *
 * **It replaces the workspace listing, it does not extend it.** What used to be here was
 * every workspace with its vision text and its chats — the axis ADR 0036 had just given the
 * strip above, answered a second time in more words. That duplication is what made the
 * operator ask what the left sidebar was for.
 *
 * What the left gets instead is the level the three strips do not reach. A workspace holds
 * several clones and several worktrees, and until now nothing in the window selected one.
 *
 * **Picking something here decides where the next chat starts**, which is what makes this a
 * selector rather than a second listing. `New tab` starts in the focused workspace's own
 * directory until a piece is picked, and in that piece afterwards. Nothing is started by
 * picking: the picker still asks which profile and which persona, and the core still decides
 * whether that directory can be started in — it writes the harness layer there or refuses
 * with a sentence naming what stopped it.
 *
 * **A clone is a heading, and it is picked from its menu rather than by a click.** A click on
 * the heading opens and closes it, which is what a heading does; the pick is `Start new chats
 * in <repo>` on the clone's context menu, beside `New tab in <repo>` (charter-app#174). Both
 * carry the path the core spelled (`Panels.paths`), so nothing here joins one together, and a
 * picked clone is marked the way a picked piece is.
 *
 * **Every row that is a place has a context menu, and each is the catalogue filtered to that
 * place** (charter-app#174). A piece's is merge above the line and remove below it; a clone's
 * is the two rows above and nothing below, because nothing in this window writes to a clone.
 * Nothing here says what those rows mean — `Menus.tsx` draws whatever `actions.ts` has, and
 * Shift+F10 or the menu key opens the same menu on the row the arrows are on.
 *
 * **It is drawn as a tree, and the lines are drawn by the rows rather than by the lists.**
 * The nesting was always here — workspace, clone, piece, chat — and nothing said so: four
 * levels of `padding-inline-start` and no line to follow, which is what the operator meant by
 * *"trees are not looking like tree"*. Each row draws its own vertical segment and its own
 * elbow (`App.css`, `.explorer .pieces > li::before`), so the last row's segment simply stops
 * at the elbow. The usual trick — a line on the list, masked at the bottom by a rectangle in
 * the background colour — cannot be used here, because **a region moves** (ADR 0038): the
 * explorer put in the bottom slot sits on `surface.deep`, and a mask painted in `surface.base`
 * would be a visible block. A row that draws its own line has no background to know.
 *
 * **A row never folds, and the region scrolls sideways instead.** The operator's words:
 * *"all trees components texts should not be breakable to new line — it should be horizontal
 * scrollable."* A row names one thing, and a name broken across two lines takes the tree with
 * it — the guides, the indent and the eye all read down a column of first lines. The rule is
 * in `App.css` beside the guides, because it had to be written without touching the padding
 * and the font size those elbows are tuned to. Sentences charter says about a FAILURE still
 * wrap; they are not rows. Neither half of this can be asserted in jsdom, which lays nothing
 * out: `workspace-explorer.e2e.ts` measures the rows and the elbows in the real WebView.
 *
 * **It is a tree, the WAI-ARIA "Tree View" pattern, whole** (charter-app#238). #189 gave it
 * the half that needs no tree semantics; a screen reader was still told it was a list and a
 * `<details>`, and Left and Right did nothing. Now:
 *
 * - **`role="tree"`, and every row a `treeitem`** with its `aria-level` and its place among
 *   its siblings (`aria-posinset` / `aria-setsize`). Those are written down rather than left to
 *   the DOM, because the rows are the buttons and a button cannot hold its children: the
 *   nesting a screen reader would otherwise infer runs through lists, `<details>` and wrappers
 *   that are there for the guides. {@link treeOf} is the one place the shape is decided.
 * - **`aria-expanded` on every row with children**, as the pattern asks of a parent: a clone
 *   says whether it is open, and the workspace row and a branch say `true`, because they are
 *   parents that are always open. A leaf says nothing.
 * - **Right** opens a closed clone, or moves to a row's first child. **Left** closes an open
 *   clone, or moves to the row's parent — which is also what it does on a parent that cannot
 *   close. The fold is the same state a click on the clone's heading changes.
 * - **Up, Down, Home and End** are the roving focus's, as since #189: ONE Tab stop, through
 *   `roving.ts`, and the stop at rest is the current row — the picked worktree, or the
 *   workspace itself.
 * - **Type-ahead**: a printable key moves to the next row whose name starts with it, wrapping.
 *   One key and not a typed prefix — the names are short and few, and cycling on a repeated
 *   key finds any of them.
 * - **Enter** does what a click does: it picks a worktree, opens a file, and on a
 *   clone's heading opens or closes it, which `<summary>` does natively.
 *
 * Left and Right are taken from the region's sideways scroll while a row has the keyboard. A
 * focused row is scrolled into view by the engine, so nothing the keyboard can reach is lost.
 *
 * **A branch expands into its files** (FM-1, #1103). Under each branch, and under each repo for
 * the repo's own folder (#948), a *Files* row folds open onto that folder's first level, and
 * each folder onto the next — read only when it is opened (`branchFolders.ts`), and read again
 * when an agent adds or removes a file in it. They are rows of the same tree: the same levels,
 * the same arrows, Home and End, and Enter on a file opens it in its file tab. Folders come
 * first, in the order a person reads names. What git ignores is hidden until *Show ignored
 * files* is pressed, and then drawn dimmed and never opened; a file charter will not open — a
 * link out of the branch, git's own folder, a FIFO — is drawn with the reason. The *Files* row
 * is a child of the branch rather than the branch row folding itself, because a click on a
 * branch picks where the next chat starts.
 *
 * **What a branch changed is marked on it** (FM-4, #1107): each file it changed, added,
 * deleted or renamed against the branch it was cut from, committed or not, and each folder
 * holding such a file with how many, read again as agents write (`branchStatus.ts`). A file
 * the branch deleted is drawn where it was, and does not open. *Changed only* collapses every
 * open branch's files to what it changed, every folder of it open. The *Filter files* box
 * narrows the file rows drawn to names holding what is typed, keeping the folders on the way to
 * one; Esc clears it.
 *
 * **A file or folder row has a menu that changes nothing** (FM-10, #1113): copy its path,
 * relative or absolute, reveal it in the file manager, your editor for a file and a shell tab
 * for a folder (`actions.fileRows`). Never create, rename, move or delete (ADR 0081, V86 F8):
 * charter does not race an agent writing the same tree. Each row names the branch and the path
 * inside it; the core places it (`files::place`), so no path the window joined leaves it.
 *
 * **Focused on one branch, it is that branch's cockpit** (FM-5, #1108; V86 F2): a breadcrumb
 * back out, the branch's state — how far it is from its base, how many files it changed, and
 * Merge and Done — then its files, as rows of a tree of their own
 * with the same keys. Esc, or the breadcrumb, steps back out to the whole workspace, and the
 * keyboard lands on the branch's row. Which branch is the window's (`PlaneView.tsx`), and it is
 * remembered with the window's views.
 *
 * **It draws no chats** (#1673, B-12). It drew a workspace's chats where each worked (#1490),
 * and the Chats view drew them again; with the two now views of one side, one at a time, the
 * Chats view is the one place a chat is listed and this is the place: workspace, repos,
 * branches and files. A branch still answers "is anything already running here" in the chats'
 * own words, in the Chats view, and by the live marks below.
 *
 * **It is in three sections, each folding on its heading** (#1677, spec #1671 B-12), an
 * editor's explorer: *Workspaces*, the project's workspaces in the strip's order with the focused
 * one current, where a press focuses one exactly as its tab on the strip does (the same
 * catalogue row, `workspace.focus:<name>`, and the same menu); *Repos and branches*, the
 * focused workspace's own tree; and *Files*, of where the next chat starts — the picked branch
 * or repo, or each repo's own folder while the workspace itself is picked. Each section's tree
 * is its own Tab stop. A folded section is hidden and stays mounted, so its folds and the place
 * the keyboard was in it come back with it; which ones are folded is kept in the layout file
 * (`explorerSections.ts`). Only the workspaces are a list the strip also draws, and they are
 * not a tablist: the strip stays the axis (ADR 0036), and this is a way to it.
 *
 * **What a chat is touching right now is marked live** (FM-6, #1109; V86 F6): a file a chat's
 * tool reads or edits, and every folder above it up to the branch's *Files* row, carry a dot
 * naming the chat on hover, which fades a few seconds after the chat goes quiet on it
 * (`touching.ts`). The core confined the path to the chat's own folder, and it was written
 * nowhere (D-86a).
