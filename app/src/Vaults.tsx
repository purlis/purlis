/**
 * The plane's vaults, in the Attention region: each vault with its provider and how many
 * secrets it holds (charter-app#234), and **pressing one opens its tab** (charter-app#235).
 *
 * **Names and counts, and never a value.** `vault_list` answers with nothing else
 * (`app/src-tauri/src/vaults.rs`, whose test serializes every answer and looks for the values
 * it wrote), so there is nothing here that could draw one.
 *
 * **Made and deleted from here too** (SI-3): the heading's `+` is `vault.create`, and each row's
 * context menu offers `vault.remove:<name>`, which asks in `DeleteVault` before anything goes.
 *
 * **The plane's, not the workspace's.** A vault is registered once per plane, so this section
 * is drawn whichever workspace is focused, and with none.
 *
 * **The window asks, and this draws** (`useVaults`, held by `PlaneView`): the same answer is
 * the palette's `vault.open:<name>` rows and the picker's list, and a vault's tab asks the window
 * to read it again after a write — so one list, read in one place, serves all four.
