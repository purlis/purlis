/**
 * What has contributed what to this window, and the question charter asks before anything new
 * contributes at all.
 *
 * **This is ADR 0041's registry, and the runtime is behind it, not in it.** An extension is a
 * directory the operator points at; charter reads its manifest, hashes its whole directory,
 * lists what it says it brings — each capability it asks for first (ADR 0053), then its themes,
 * panels, views and program — and puts none of it in force until it is approved. A declared
 * program is started by the core's executor when the operator opens one of its views, and
 * never from here: this dialog only reads, asks and records the answer. A manifest asking for a
 * capability this charter does not know is listed as refused, in the core's sentence naming it.
 *
 * **A built-in extension ships inside charter** (charter-app#339) and is trusted through the
 * app, so it has nothing to review. It is marked "built-in", and it is turned off on this
 * machine rather than removed — the app would bring a removed one back at the next read. A
 * project or a workspace turns it off as it turns off any extension (Project settings).
 *
 * **It is called an extension and not a plugin, everywhere, deliberately.** `enabledPlugins` in
 * the first-open dialog is Claude Code's plugin list, travelling in a project's committed
 * settings. Two things called "plugin" in two lists in one window is a consent surface that has
 * stopped being read (ADR 0041).
 *
 * **The honest sentence is not written here.** {@link ExtensionAsk.runs_as_you} comes out of
 * `purlis_core::extension::RUNS_AS_YOU` and is rendered as given. A dialog that composed its
 * own words about what an extension can reach would drift kinder than the truth one edit at a
 * time — and the truth is that a subprocess runs as the operator does, so what is listed is a
 * declaration and never a limit. A prompt that implied a cage would be worse than no prompt: it
 * would manufacture confidence charter cannot back.
