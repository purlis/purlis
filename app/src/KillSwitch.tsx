/**
 * **The kill switch** (OV-1, ADR 0071): stop every chat and shell charter started — in every
 * project and window — and start no chat until the operator re-arms it. Agents charter did not
 * start, headless ones among them, are not reached (OV-2).
 *
 * On the title bar because it is about the whole app and not one project, and because the
 * title bar is on screen in every window. **One press, with no question in between**: a switch
 * that asks first is not one an operator can reach for. Nothing is lost by a press made by
 * mistake — the chats stay as tabs, each reading as one whose program ended, and re-arming lets
 * the operator reopen them.
 *
 * **What it draws is what the core says**, never what the press hoped for: the core's answer
 * to `agents_stopped` after every press, and every `kill-switch` event. A stop the core could
 * not keep on disk is still a stop in the app, and the bar says so out loud, because the next
 * launch may not know.
 *
 * `charter stop --all` in a terminal throws the same switch; the core hears it and every
 * window's bar is told. Re-arming is here and only here: a command any agent could run cannot be
 * the thing that lets agents start again.
