/**
 * Deleting a workspace: what goes, what charter can see that would be lost with it, and two
 * separate answers rather than one.
 *
 * **The core is what decides, and this surface is careful never to look like it does.**
 * `charter workspace remove` refuses over work that removing the workspace would discard —
 * `wscmd::work_at_risk`: a clone charter could not read, a dirty tree, unpushed commits, a
 * worktree holding commits reachable from no other ref — and that guard runs inside the
 * command, between the name check and `remove_dir_all`. So:
 *
 * - **What this lists is a preview and is drawn as one.** `workspace_at_risk` reads the same
 *   guard so that the operator knows before pressing what charter is going to say. It is not
 *   the decision; the delete asks again, in the core, against the disk at that moment. A
 *   window that treated the preview as the answer would be deciding on a reading taken while
 *   somebody read a dialog.
 * - **The first press never forces.** It runs the delete with `force: false`, and a refusal
 *   comes back in the core's own words.
 * - **Forcing is a second press on a sentence that has been read.** The button does not exist
 *   until the refusal does, and it names what it will discard. This is `worktree.discard`'s
 *   rule in `actions.ts` — *"there is nothing to warn about until the refusal exists, and then
 *   the row appears beside it"* — and it is the reason no catalogue row carries a `force`.
 * - **And it names it out of the refusal, never out of the preview** (charter-app#182). Once
 *   there has been an attempt, the list above and the words on the button both come from
 *   `refusal.at_risk` — the reading the core made *inside* the delete. The preview is what is
 *   drawn before the first press and nothing after it. A workspace can change while a dialog
 *   is open, and a button naming `svc` under a sentence naming `lib` is two descriptions of
 *   one act that do not agree, at the moment consent is given.
 *
 * Radix's `AlertDialog` rather than `Dialog` (`docs/ui-primitives.md`): it is the primitive for
 * a question whose answer destroys something. It focuses Cancel by itself, it makes Escape
 * mean Cancel, and its content is `role="alertdialog"` — so what a screen reader is handed
 * first is the sentence about what is about to be lost, not a heading and a pair of buttons.
