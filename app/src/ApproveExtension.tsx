/**
 * What this extension says it brings, what charter will actually do about it, and — in charter's
 * own plain voice — what charter is not able to stop it doing.
 *
 * **The last part is the reason this component exists and is why it is written the way it is.**
 * The operator ruled on 2026-09-22 that charter ships the extension runtime with no OS sandbox,
 * with marketplace vetting and untrusted-source warnings as the deferred answer. charter ADR
 * 0041's honesty paragraph is what he ruled against: *a subprocess does not confine an extension
 * below the operator. It runs as the same user, with the same filesystem, the same network and
 * the same ability to `exec`.* So the capability list is a statement about **charter's conduct**
 * and not a cage, and a dialog that listed "this extension may: contribute a theme" as though
 * that were the limit would manufacture confidence charter cannot back. **That is worse than no
 * dialog**, because a surface that over-promises is one the operator stops reading and then
 * trusts anyway.
 *
 * So the sentences that say so are `ask.runs_as_you`, `ask.fingerprint_note` and — when there is
 * one — `ask.state_note`, they come from `purlis_core::extension`, they are pinned by tests in
 * that crate, and this component renders them **as given**. Nothing here composes a reassurance
 * of its own. Nothing here summarises them shorter.
 *
 * The rest follows ADR 0035's first-open prompt, which is the pattern: show what it contributes,
 * ask once per machine, remember the fingerprint, re-ask when what it contributes changes. The
 * one difference, and it is 0041's: **0035 fingerprints configuration and this fingerprints
 * code.** An extension's path is not its contents, so the hash is over its whole directory,
 * re-taken at each launch.
 *
 * **`state_note` is the exception to the sentence above it, and it is drawn next to it for that
 * reason** (charter-app#152). The fingerprint note says charter read every file in the
 * extension's directory; an extension that declares a state directory has one directory charter
 * does not read, and which one that is belongs on the screen where the operator says yes rather
 * than in a doc comment. It is absent for an extension that declares no state directory, which
 * is the ordinary case and has no exception to state.
 *
 * A Radix dialog (`docs/ui-primitives.md`), so "has to be answered" is a property of the surface
 * rather than a claim about how it was drawn. Escape answers it the way Cancel does: nothing is
 * approved and the next ask is a first ask again. A click outside is not an answer — missing a
 * dialog is not a decision.
