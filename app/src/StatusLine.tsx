/**
 * **charter's status line**: one line at the very bottom of the window, under everything.
 *
 * The operator asked for it in as many words — *"project directory in right corner — lets move
 * to bottom, at most bottom of charter new one line bar, and it will be status line - and show
 * general infos"*. The project's path used to sit at the right-hand end of `header.bar`, in a
 * row with the tab strip, the `+`, the split buttons and the region toggles; it is here now,
 * and it is the only place it is drawn.
 *
 * # It is NOT a region, and that is a decision
 *
 * ADR 0038's window is regions — left, centre, right (and a bottom one until #1676) — and
 * `app/src/regions.ts` makes adding one a line in a catalogue and a line in an arrangement.
 * This is deliberately not that, and the reasons are in the shape of the thing rather than in
 * taste:
 *
 * - **Every slot in the arrangement is sized as a percentage of its group.** `SLOTS`,
 *   `CATALOGUE.size`, `slotSize` and `startingSize` are all percentages, because that is what
 *   `react-resizable-panels` takes. A status line is one line of text: its height is a font
 *   and two paddings, and the percentage that happens to equal that at 1080 px is the wrong
 *   one at 4K. There is no honest number to put in the catalogue.
 * - **A region resizes and can be put away; this does neither.** The toggles are drawn from the
 *   arrangement (`SIDES.flatMap`), so a region arrives with a button that hides it — which is
 *   the right rule for a region and the wrong one for the line that says where you are and
 *   which project you are in. A status line an operator can lose is one they will lose and then
 *   report as a bug. That those toggles are now drawn *on* this line does not weaken the
 *   argument, it sharpens it: the line carries every region's way back and has none of its own,
 *   which is what makes it the frame rather than a tenant. `FourRegions.test.tsx`'s *"cannot be
 *   put away, because it is not a region"* is the guard.
 * - **It is the frame, not a tenant of it.** `.projects`, in the title bar, sits above the
 *   regions and is not in the arrangement either. The window is chrome, regions, chrome;
 *   this is the bottom half of the chrome, and `RegionFrame` is untouched by it — which is also
 *   why this change moved no JSX inside the frame and added no fourth `Panel` to a live group
 *   (charter-app#141's throw is a thing to stay away from, not a thing to test against).
 *
 * **What that costs, said rather than hidden:** the line cannot be resized, put away, or moved
 * to another side, and nothing remembers anything about it. If it is ever wanted as a region,
 * `regions.ts` is exactly where it goes and nothing here blocks that — the content is already
 * a component taking props, which is the shape a region's content has.
 *
 * # What is on the line, and the rules it is composed by
 *
 * charter's own footer is the starting point rather than an invention:
 * `crates/purlis-core/src/footer.rs` draws `⬢ alpha · todo 3 · pieces 2 1 done · ws 4` as
 * zone 1, *"where I am"*, and it arrived at that over a long time. Three of its rules are
 * taken whole:
 *
 * - **A count lives next to the thing it counts.** The todos are the focused workspace's, so
 *   they sit beside its name; the pieces are that workspace's worktrees, said as `branches N`
 *   because the window says branch for a piece (ADR 0072, #602); `ws N` is how many
 *   others there are; and `N chats running` is the project's, which is why it came here when
 *   the title bar's breadcrumb went (ADR 0054).
 * - **Zero renders NOTHING.** A `todo 0` present every turn is furniture within a day, and a
 *   real `todo 7` in that spot then draws no more attention than the zero did. Presence is the
 *   signal.
 * - **Never a number charter cannot stand behind.** A count charter could not read is dropped,
 *   never rounded to zero — a partial total is a wrong total, and the two cannot be told apart
 *   once they are both a number on a line.
 *
 * **The one duplication, named rather than hidden**, the way ADR 0038 names its own: the
 * focused workspace is on the strip above too. They are not the same statement. The strip is
 * the *selector* — at ADR 0026's ten workspaces it scrolls, and reading it means finding the
 * selected tab among the others; this *states* the answer, in one place that never moves. That
 * is the same relationship charter's footer has to `charter ws list`, and it is the whole
 * reason zone 1 exists.
 *
 * **What is left off, and why.** The `ctx`/`cache` gauges and the usage trend are per-chat and
 * have no renderer ported — ADR 0038 names both as open, and a window-wide gauge would be one
 * conversation's number under fifty. `doctor` is one button here (`Doctor.tsx` argues why the
 * frame and not a region) and the plane's pin is another (`Updates.tsx`). Repos and
 * CI are the Changes view's (the bottom region's until #1676), and a status line that drew
 * them would be a second copy of it.
 *
 * **And the update offer is NOT here any more.** It was, beside the pin, and the two read as
 * one pair of "version facts" — but only one of them is about a project. The pin is
 * `charter version`'s verdict on THIS plane's `[charter] version` (ADR 0030), so two
 * open projects can honestly disagree about it and it belongs on the line that names the
 * project. An update offer is about the app: the same offer whichever project is in front, and
 * the line is drawn once per project, so eight projects meant eight `useUpdates` clients
 * listening for one event. It is on the title bar now — the window's own chrome, drawn once
 * (`TitleBar.tsx`). Moved rather than copied: two surfaces stating one fact is the shape
 * charter refuses, and the duplication this line already carries is named above and argued for.
