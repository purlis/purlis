/**
 * **About Charter**: which version of the app this is, and what that version brought.
 *
 * The operator asked for it on the title bar's right-hand side, and said what it should open:
 * *"About Charter — that will open news of charter e.g. current version News"*.
 *
 * # The app's version and the app's changelog
 *
 * `app/src-tauri/src/about.rs` answers with the version this build announces (the one the
 * updater compares and the GitHub release is named for) and that version's section of the
 * repository's `CHANGELOG.md`, which is compiled into the binary. The release workflow puts the
 * same section on the GitHub release, so this dialog and the release page say the same thing.
 * `charter news` prints the same file in a terminal.
 *
 * What is drawn follows what the build is (`Build` in the bindings):
 *
 * - **a release**: the version, its date, and its section;
 * - **a dev build** (`0.2.0-dev.42`): a dev build of the next version, and `[Unreleased]` as
 *   what it has so far;
 * - **a version the changelog does not list**, such as a local build of `main`: said plainly,
 *   with `[Unreleased]` beside it.
 *
 * Under that, whatever the build is, the Cargo profile it was made with: `release` for a stable
 * build, `dev-release` for a dev channel build (ADR 0092). The two are the same source and not
 * the same binary, so a report of a slow one can say which it was.
 *
 * The notes are Markdown and are drawn as Markdown (`ReleaseNotes.tsx`). The body scrolls
 * inside a bounded height, so the title and Close stay put however long a release is.
 *
 * # Asked when it is opened, and once
 *
 * The changelog is compiled in and the version is the bundle's, so the answer cannot change
 * while the process runs. And a launch does not pay for a dialog nobody opened: this is the
 * one surface in the window most operators open once a release. What IS drawn on failure is
 * the ask failing, because a command can always fail.
