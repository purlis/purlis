/**
 * The screen a window with no project open draws.
 *
 * **It is not the error page, and the difference is the whole point.** charter used to answer
 * a launch outside a plane with `No plane: …` and nothing to do about it, which is the screen
 * the operator met when he double-clicked the app — an error about a concept he did not have
 * yet, on a window that offered no way to get one. ADR 0033 is the decision that a project IS
 * a plane and that the app opens one; this is the door, and `plane_at_launch`'s three shapes
 * are what decide which sentence it opens with.
 *
 * - **Nothing to go on** (`here` false) — an app started from the dock, whose working
 *   directory is `/`. "You have not opened a project yet." A newcomer's first screen, and it
 *   reports nothing, because nothing went wrong.
 * - **A directory that is in no project** (`here` true) — `charter` run somewhere ordinary.
 *   charter says where it looked and what it looked for, because that operator asked a
 *   question and deserves the answer.
 *
 * Neither is an alert. What both offer is the same: a folder to pick, a path to type, and the
 * projects this machine remembers.
 *
 * **A machine that remembers no project gets the first run instead** (FR-4, #603): a launch
 * with nothing to go on, on a machine whose recent list is empty, is somebody who has never
 * had a project, and "a project is a directory with a `charter.toml` in it" is a concept they
 * should not need before their first chat. `FirstRun` asks for a repository and nothing else,
 * and this screen stays one press behind it.
