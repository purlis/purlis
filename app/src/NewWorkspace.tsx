/**
 * Making a workspace, asked where the answer is given.
 *
 * **The prompt IS the prompt** (ADR 0035, and `ApprovePlane` says the same thing about
 * the trust ask). The CLI's shape here is `charter workspace create <name> --vision "…"`; the
 * window has a person looking at it, so it asks for the two things that command takes and
 * nothing is copied from the printed-command shape.
 *
 * **This dialog validates nothing.** What a workspace may be called is
 * `contain::workspace_name_ok`, reached through `workspace_create` → `wscmd::create` →
 * `wscmd::ensure`, which is the same path `charter workspace create` takes — so the app refuses
 * exactly the names a terminal refuses and says the same sentence about them. A check written
 * here would be a second answer to "what may a workspace be called", and the two would drift
 * the first time either moved. The only thing the button asks of the box is that it has
 * something in it, which is not a rule about names: it is the difference between a question
 * that has been answered and one that has not.
 *
 * A vision is optional and says so. It is the one field that is easier to fill now than later —
 * `workspace.md` is the living charter a fork inherits, and charter nags about an empty one on
 * every command — but a workspace with no vision is a workspace, and the core's own line
 * explains how to add one afterwards.
 *
 * **Its repos are picked from what the operator's own forge login reaches** (ADR 0055), and
 * cloned after the workspace is made — the dialog closes at once and each repo lands on its
 * own. Picking none is a workspace with no repos, which is still a workspace.
 *
 * Its form is drawn from the settings set (DS-3e): a row per answer, and its buttons a
 * `SettingActions`.
