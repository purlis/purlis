                        `useRoom` is told to take their width off the room the tabs get rather
                        than leaving the tabs to be squeezed under them.

                        **A `+` and not a labelled button** — the operator's: *"open-project button
                        is not looks like separate button, but it should looks like new tab, without
                        label — just icon."* It is the same shape as the chat strip's `New tab` one
                        level down: the `+` at the end of a strip makes one more of what the strip
                        lists. Its accessible name is still the catalogue's `Open a project…`.

                        **And beside it, the other half of the same sentence** — *"also we need to
                        have create new project button too"* (charter-app#178). Two controls and not
                        one menu: opening a project the operator already has and making one that does
                        not exist yet are different acts, and the second writes to disk. It is drawn
                        exactly as its neighbour is — one `Doer` over the catalogue's
                        `project.create`, icon-only, named `New project…` by the same row the palette
                        and the tab's menu read — so there is still one place those words are written
                        down. It is second because opening one is the commoner act; both are always
                        available, including with no project open, which is exactly the window that
                        needs them.

                        And the projects there was no room for, in the same component the chat strip
                        uses, so an operator learns one control for all three strips. */}
