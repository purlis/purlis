/**
 * **The Inbox** (#1692, spec #1688): everything in this project that waits on the person, at the
 * top of the right side's activity bar, the "for you" side (ADR 0038 as amended 2026-10-10).
 *
 * **One list, from the asks registry** (#1690): grouped by the chat that asks, the chat that has
 * waited longest first, each group under its chain (`steward 12 › #3046 drill › log watch`, I-9).
 * An ask is gone from here the moment its source stops waiting, wherever it was answered (I-8).
 *
 * **Answered in place, through the ask's own path** (I-3): the registry names the command its
 * source's Notice answers with, and a button here sends exactly that (`asks.answerTaken`).
 * Nothing new is opened, and an answer here clears its Notice on the chat's pane, because both
 * are drawn from the same source:
 *
 * - **a permission** prompt and a choice of several: each option the harness offered is a button;
 * - **a sandbox host**: Allow at each level policy leaves open, and Keep blocked; an Allow owes
 *   the chat its restart, as the block Notice's does, unless its proxy took it live (`onAnswered`);
 * - **a dispatch grant** is its own Notice, drawn here whole (`DispatchGrantNotice`): the brief,
 *   what the target works with and the boxes its digest is bound to are read before any Allow,
 *   and it reads the very list the pane's copy reads, so answering one clears the other;
 * - **a question** a chat's turn ended on gets a reply box, sent as the person's message;
 * - **a prompt in a harness's own terminal** says so, and is answered there.
 *
 * Every ask has **Go to chat**, which for a task opens it in its session's tab (`onGo`).
 *
 * **The keyboard** (I-11): ↑ and ↓ move between the asks and their buttons, Enter presses the
 * focused button, as it does anywhere, and Escape leaves for the chat in front. **No key of a
 * single letter does anything**, so a stray keystroke never answers an ask. The keyboard comes
 * in on the first ask itself, never on a button.
 *
 * **What an ask says is data** (I-1, #1690): a chain a chat named, a command line, a host are
 * drawn as text, and the only controls are the fixed words of the answers it offers.
 *
 * **Empty, it says so** (I-12) — "Nothing is waiting on you" — and lists what was answered here
 * lately, read-only: when, which chat, what it asked and the answer.
 *
 * **The project's Notices follow the asks** (#1695, I-4): what stood under the tab strip and what
 * the Alerts drawer listed, each a Notice with its ways out (`notices`), the most important
 * first (`NoticeList`). They wait on nothing the person must decide, so they come after the
 * asks; they stand until they are dealt with, so they come before what merely happened.
 *
 * **Updates follow, newest first** (#1693, I-6): a task that finished or failed, a
 * doctor finding, a chat that came back, a sandbox change, a dispatch refused while nobody was
 * there, a Smart close that stopped. Each has Dismiss, and Go to chat where it is about one; a
 * refused dispatch has its own three answers. **Mark all read and Dismiss all act on updates
 * alone** (I-10): an ask is never answered in bulk, so neither button is drawn among them.
