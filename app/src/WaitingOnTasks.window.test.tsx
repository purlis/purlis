/**
 * **A session waiting on its tasks says so, counts them, and is flagged only for what
 * matters** (#1491), against the whole window.
 *
 * What the operator saw: a session whose turn had ended while its tasks worked wore the mark
 * of a chat waiting on him. The core now keeps such a session out of the needs-you queue; this
 * is what the window then says of it: `waiting on 2 tasks` in both lists, the count on its
 * row, the hand for a task that failed and none for one that is done.
 *
 * The core's answers are fixtures: the chats it lists, the finished rows it reads from its
 * dispatch records, and the moves it sends.
