 * V100-18), against the whole window: the two rows on a task's row menu, the two buttons on
 * the breadcrumb's line while a tab shows the task, the second step every ending takes (in
 * place for an idle task, the one modal question for a task mid-turn), and the words its row
 * says afterwards. **Nothing here ends a task on one press**, and no close ends one at all.
 *
 * The core here is a fixture. It answers `task_ending` with what ending a task would do, as
 * the real one reads it from its own records, and takes `end_task`. What the chat that asked
 * is then told is the core's, and is tested there.
