/**
 * **Make a workspace LIVE or LOCAL** (charter-app#301, ADR 0051): what it publishes, where it
 * goes, and a yes before anything happens. Opened from the workspace's menu, the palette, and
 * Settings at its level (SE-20) — one dialog, so the three say the same thing.
 *
 * LIVE publishes the workspace's charter, memory and todos with the project, and the project is
 * saved at once: going LIVE is an explicit intent to publish. What a person reads says
 * "project", never "plane" (#1192). LOCAL stops publishing them (they
 * stay on disk) and saves the untracking; what was pushed before stays in history, and the
 * dialog says so rather than let "private" suggest otherwise.
 *
 * **Whether the remote is public** (#1369): going LIVE, the dialog names the remote and asks
 * its forge who can read it — the doctor's `project remote` read (`plane_remote_readers`). That
 * asks the network, so it is asked apart from what the dialog reads first: the files and the
 * remote are on screen at once, the answer follows, and Make live does not wait for it. A forge
 * that does not answer is said as not known, with its reason, and never as private.
