/**
 * **W10's interrupt budget past the first run** (DS-9, #1078): at most three prompts stand
 * between the operator and the next answered agent turn, on every way back to a chat and not
 * only a new machine's. `FirstRun.test.tsx` holds the first run's ways, the sign-in to a forge
 * first among them; this file holds the rest: a relaunch (reopen or fresh), a restart to
 * update, opening someone else's project, and a handoff.
 *
 * Each scenario renders the flow's real surfaces in the order the operator meets them and takes
 * its longest way: the answer that leaves the most still to ask, and the trust question where
 * the flow can raise it. No agent answers here (the pane is a stand-in), so every prompt counted
 * is one before that turn. `interruptBudget.ts` says what counts as a prompt and what it
 * cannot see.
 *
 * **Two ways go past the budget, and are not held here** but on #1078's checklist, since
 * holding them is a change to the flow and not to a test: a restart to update over a chat
 * mid-turn that then starts fresh asks a fourth prompt (the picker), and a relaunch whose
 * restore holds two projects that changed since they were approved asks the trust question
 * twice.
