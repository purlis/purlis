/**
 * **The Inbox's updates** (#1693, spec #1688, I-6, I-8, I-10): what happened that the person
 * may want to know and need not answer. Listed after the asks, newest first.
 *
 * **Each comes from a source that already says it**, derived here by a plain function with no
 * state, so each rule is tested on its own:
 *
 * - a task that finished or came to nothing: its finished row ({@link taskUpdates});
 * - a finding of the doctor: its report ({@link doctorUpdates});
 * - a chat that came back, resumed or fresh: the chats a launch or a Resume put back
 *   ({@link resumeUpdates});
 * - a sandbox change that asks nothing: a block that is no host ask ({@link sandboxUpdates});
 * - a dispatch refused while nobody was there (#1507): the away list ({@link awayUpdates});
 * - a Smart close that stopped without its record (SI-8f) ({@link smartCloseUpdates}).
 *
 * **Kept a day on this machine, never in a project** (`note_inbox_updates`, I-8): the window
 * notes what it derived, by a key of its source's own, and the core keeps it in purlis's data
 * home, so the same update noted again is one update, a relaunch keeps it, and one the person
 * dismissed does not come back while its source still says it.
 *
 * **The last two are answered at their source**, so they are drawn only while it still lists
 * them ({@link LIVE}): a refused dispatch with its three answers, a stopped Smart close with
 * Go and Dismiss. Every other update stands for its day.
 *
 * **Dismiss all and Mark all read act on updates alone** (I-10): no ask is ever answered in
 * bulk ({@link useInboxUpdates}).
