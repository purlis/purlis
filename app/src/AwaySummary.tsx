/**
 * **While you were away: one summary of what happened** (#1514, V100-65).
 *
 * One Notice in each project's Inbox, drawn when the person comes back after
 * {@link AWAY_AFTER_MS} or more away from this window, and only when something happened
 * meanwhile: "While you were away: 7 tasks done, 1 failed, 2 waiting on you". What it counts
 * is `awayCounts.ts`'s; when the person was away is {@link useTimeAway}'s, which the project's
 * view holds whether or not it is in front ({@link useAwaySummary}), so each project of a
 * window has its own.
 *
 * **Each part is a link to the chats it counts.** A part of one goes straight there; a part of
 * several opens a list of them, each of which goes to its own. A chat waiting on you is shown
 * where it lives (its question, its Notice, its prompt are there, answerable as they always
 * are); a finished task goes where a needs-you item's Go takes it: its chat while that is
 * open, else its finished row under the session that asked, where its report is. A dispatch
 * refused while nobody was at its chat (#1507) opens the Inbox, where it is an update and it
 * is answered (#1551). Every line
 * the tasks and their sessions said stays in each session's Activity.
 *
 * **It answers nothing and hides nothing.** Going to a failed task marks that failure looked
 * at, as the needs-you item's Go does, which takes its hand off the title bar; that is the one
 * thing a press here writes. Dismiss puts the summary away and nothing else: a question still
 * waits where it was asked, a needs-you item stays on the title bar's list, a failed task's row
 * stands.
 *
 * **Off in Settings** (`chats.away`, "Away summary"), nothing is watched and nothing is drawn,
 * and the window is as it was before it.

 *
 * **Away is any of three things, for {@link AWAY_AFTER_MS} or more**, as the window reads the
 * person's presence elsewhere (the Chats list lets go on `blur`; a project fetches on `focus`):
 *
 * - the window not the one in use: from `blur` to `focus`;
 * - the window hidden: from `visibilitychange` to hidden, to visible again;
 * - **no input while it is in use**: no pointer, key or wheel on it. The time away began at the
 *   last input, and the first input after it is the return. A display that slept over a window
 *   left in front fires neither `blur` nor `focus`.
 *
 * A window that starts without the focus is away from its start.
 *

 * way back that was not on the way out, or that was and has something new for them since,
 * came to need them while they were away ({@link cameToNeedOf}).
 *
 * **Only the current time away is ever counted with what is still standing.** Another time
 * away adds to a summary that still says something; a summary that says nothing any more (its
 * parts were answered or cleared) lets its times go, as does one that still says nothing
 * {@link SETTLES_MS} after its return, so nothing read later can bring an old time back. A
 * reload or a relaunch starts with none.
