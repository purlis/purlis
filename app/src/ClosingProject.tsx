/**
 * What charter asks before it closes a project that has chats open.
 *
 * **The project's `×` ended every chat in it without a word**, and that was tolerable while it
 * was a small target under the pointer. charter-app#239 put the same row one key away — Delete
 * on the focused tab, and on a Mac the ordinary delete key — and the operator ruled that
 * closing a project with chats running asks first, as ending one chat does (`EndingChat`).
 *
 * **Asked where the row's verb is carried out**, `closeProject` in `App.tsx`, so every surface
 * that presses `project.close:<plane>` asks it: the `×`, Delete, the tab's menu and the
 * palette. A project with nothing open closes as it always did, without a question.
 *
 * **It says what goes, in the quit warning's words and rows** (`QuitWarning.tsx`): how many
 * chats end, in which workspaces, and each chat with what it is doing. A question that said
 * only "are you sure?" would be asking the operator to remember what is in a project they
 * may not be looking at.
 *
 * **An `AlertDialog`, for `EndingChat`'s reasons**: it arrives because of something the
 * operator did, a click outside answers nothing, Escape answers Cancel, and Cancel is first and
 * focused so a stray Return keeps everything. When it closes, the focus goes back to where it
 * was (`useFocusBack`) — the project's tab, when the question came from Delete on it.
