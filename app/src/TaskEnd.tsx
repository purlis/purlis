 * tab's close: nothing here offers a Smart close, and the standard close dialog is never shown
 * for a task.
 *

 * press on a task's row, on Delete, or on the breadcrumb's two controls is answered where it
 * was made: "Stop it" or "Close it" beside "Keep", with the keyboard on Keep, so a stray press
 * or a stray Return ends nothing. **The one modal question** is for a task in the middle of a
 * turn and for one with tasks of its own still at work (asked once: end them too, or keep
 * them). Where purlis may not type into the task, either says why and offers Close alone.
