/**
 * **New branch**, from a repo's row (GL-1, ADR 0072 §4).
 *
 * Cuts a branch of its own in the repo — a folder and a branch beside the repo's shared clone,
 * off whatever the clone has checked out — and makes it where the next chat starts. It starts
 * nothing: the next New tab's picker still asks.
 *
 * **It validates nothing**, for `NewWorkspace`'s reason: what a branch may be called is the
 * core's rule, reached through `worktree_add`, which is the path `charter worktree add` takes,
 * so the window refuses exactly what a terminal refuses and says the same sentence. A name left
 * empty is charter's next free `chat-<n>`; a name typed is used exactly, or refused when the
 * repo already has that branch.
 *
 * On screen it says branch and never the words charter keeps for its own internals (ADR 0072
 * §3): the folder is the branch's, and only where a path is needed is it shown.
