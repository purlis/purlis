/**
 * **Files into chats** (FM-9, #1103 F7): a file, a folder, a range of lines or a search hit,
 * handed to a chat as a reference in its harness's own syntax, typed and never sent.
 *
 * The window only ever names WHAT to reference — a branch, a path inside it, and the lines —
 * never the text. The core places the path (inside the branch, no link, not `.git`), builds the
 * reference with the chat's harness adapter, and types it as one bracketed paste with nothing
 * after it, only while the chat is at its prompt (`references.rs`). Where it cannot be typed —
 * opencode, a chat mid-turn — the core puts it on the clipboard and says why.
 *
 * Three ways in, all through here:
 * - **a drag** (`dragReference`) from a file row, a search hit or the preview's selection, onto
 *   a chat's tab or its pane (`droppedReference`);
 * - **"Ask a chat about this"** and **"Add to a chat's context"** in the preview, which pick a
 *   chat (`PickAChat`), and **Shift+Enter** on a search hit, which picks one the same way
 *   (`ChatsToPick`, #1151);
 * - **"Start a chat here"** on a file or folder row (`actions.ts`, `startChatHere`).
