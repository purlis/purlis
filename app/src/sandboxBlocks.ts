 * **What each chat's sandbox blocked, until the operator puts it away** (#1338).

 * the kind of path or host, and the core sends `chat-sandbox-blocked`, which carries those words
 * and the sentence about them and nothing else: no path, argument, host or output. This keeps
 * them per chat, for the Notice on its tab. **In memory only**: the core kept its own count for
 * `purlis doctor`, and a relaunch starts with none to show.
 *
 * One block per operation and kind per chat — a command that failed on a hundred files is one
 * pattern — and at most {@link AT_MOST_PER_CHAT}, the oldest going first.
 *
 * **Several hosts refused at once are one Notice** (#1637). The core sends one block for each
 * host it named; a host that arrives while the chat holds a block of the same operation and kind
 * joins it ({@link HeldBlock.hosts}), so the person reads and answers every host in one place.
 * Each host is still answered, and held by the app, on its own ({@link eachHost}).
