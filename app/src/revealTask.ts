 *
 * A task that failed puts the hand on the session that asked for it, and the needs-you item
 * for it goes to the task's row: the row under that session where its end and its report are.
 * This is that going. The row may be folded away under its session, or under a chat above its
 * session, so those are opened first; then the row is scrolled to and given the keyboard, so
 * Enter opens its report.
 *
 * **The explorer's lines ask for a chat's own row** (#1490): the one line for a session's
 * tasks asks for the session, and the line for the tasks working at a place asks for each of
 * them. Those leave `task` out. The row is opened so what is under it is drawn, a filter that
 * would hide what was asked for is taken off and said to be, and the row is marked for a
 * moment, since a pointer's press draws no focus ring.
 *
 * Kept out of `ChatsSection.tsx`, which only calls the hook.
