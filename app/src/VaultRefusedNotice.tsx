/**
 * **A vault this chat was refused for its persona, on its tab** (#1430), like a blocked host's:
 * which vault, which persona the chat runs as, and who the vault is tagged for. It is never a
 * dead end. It offers
 *
 * - **Allow {persona} to use this vault**: every chat opened as that persona may use the vault
 *   in this project on this machine. The core takes the persona from its own record of the
 *   chat, audits it, and keeps it where no chat writes; it is listed in Settings › Sandbox ›
 *   Network, and removed there. The chat does not restart: its next run reads it. The core
 *   tells the chat to run the command again only when that is safe (a waiting chat now, a
 *   chat mid-turn when its turn ends), and otherwise the Notice says to ask the chat.
 * - **Keep blocked**: puts the Notice away. The chat's next try raises it again.
 *
 * - **Dispatch to {persona}…**, where the vault is tagged for a persona the project defines
 *   (#1438): opens Ask {persona} for this chat, the dialog its tab's menu opens, and you type
 *   what to ask. The chat's own refusal also told it how to dispatch to that persona.
 *
 * **The dialog opens empty.** What is typed there reaches the new chat as your own words, so
 * this Notice hands it nothing a chat produced: not the command that was refused, and not the
 * vault's name. It names the chat and the persona, which are purlis's own records. The dialog
 * says so when it is opened from here.
 *
 * - **Show the request**, in place of Dispatch to {persona}…, where this chat has already asked
 *   that persona and its dispatch is held for you (#1481): the Notice says so and the button
 *   goes to that question, on this pane. Dispatching is the chat's own work; the manual way is
 *   for when the chat has not asked, and offering both sent the person to an empty form while
 *   the chat's own request waited for an answer.
 *
 * Only a press does any of it. Where an administrator's policy forbids Allow, it is not
 * offered, and the Notice says what policy forbids and who set it.
 *
 * **Drawn for a chat that is not on screen** (#1538), on its session's tab: the Notice starts
 * with the chat's whole path (`NoticeOf`), so its own sentences say "it" and "that chat", never
 * "this chat", which would read as the chat on screen. On its own pane it says "this chat".
 *
 * The persona the chat runs as is drawn as the sentence's mark, on what Allow answered too
 * (#1454).
 *
 * The core holds what was refused; this reads it when the pane mounts and each time the core
 * says a chat was refused (`chat-vault-refused`), so a refusal that arrives while the pane is
 * away is on it when it comes back.
