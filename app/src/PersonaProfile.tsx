 * sends: the line it writes is read back as what a chat starts on. A persona's definition is a
 * file a chat can edit, so a name there the project does not offer is shown here as what it
 * is, picked by nothing, and cleared by any choice made.
 *
 * "None" means none: a chat handed to the persona then starts on the asking chat's profile.
 * For a persona that names its own profile that removes the line. For one that inherits a
 * profile from the persona it extends, the dialog says whose it is, and the core writes
 * `profile: none` in this persona's own definition, so it opts out and its parent is untouched.
 *
 * It writes one `profile:` line in the persona's own `persona.md`, a change to commit like any
 * other edit of that file.
