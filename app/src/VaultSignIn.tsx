/**
 * **How a 1Password vault signs in, asked, tested and stored** (#1527): the guided part of *New
 * vault*, and the whole of *Change how this vault signs in* on a vault's tab.
 *
 * 1. **How purlis signs in.** A service-account token, in a password box, or the 1Password app
 *    on this machine with the account chosen from what `op` lists or its sign-in address typed.
 * 2. **Where the items live** (a new vault only): the 1Password vault, picked from the ones that
 *    sign-in can see, or typed where it may not list them; and the item.
 * 3. **Test**: the core signs in and reads item names. What it says is the core's own sentence,
 *    by kind, never the provider program's words.
 * 4. **Create** (or **Store**, for a vault that exists) is offered after a test passed, and as
 *    "anyway" beside the reason after one that did not.
 *
 * **The token is handed over once and is never on the page.** The box is uncontrolled, read
 * from the element at the press and emptied there, exactly as the vault tab's is; the core then
 * holds the token for this set-up (`vault_setup_begin`) and the page holds a number. Nothing in
 * React state, no attribute and no answer carries it. Leaving the set-up tells the core to let
 * go of it.
 *
 * **Other vaults the token may be used for are listed, never assumed.** Each row says what
 * would be pinned for that vault and which half of the registry names it; a vault the committed
 * half names starts unticked. The ticked names go to the core with the digest of what was shown,
 * and the core gives the token only to those that still match.
