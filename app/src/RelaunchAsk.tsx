/**
 * What a launch asks before it puts anything back (charter-app#250): reopen every session, or
 * start fresh.
 *
 * The operator's words: *"on reopen - we need to suggest re-open all sessions - or start fresh
 * session, and same will work for update flow."* It is asked once, only when the last quit left
 * something open, and **nothing starts while it is up** — the core holds the launch's own
 * project back until `relaunch` has the answer, and the window restores the other projects
 * after it (`App.tsx`).
 *
 * **Every way out that is not the "Start fresh" button is "Reopen all"**: the first button,
 * which has the keyboard, and Escape, which is the primitive's `Cancel`. Starting fresh clears
 * the record, and an answer lost to a stray key must never be the one that throws work away.
 *
 * **Radix's `AlertDialog`**, for `EndingChat`'s reasons: it arrives without being asked for, a
 * click outside answers nothing, and the primitive requires the `Cancel` the focus goes to.
 * Both answers carry `tabIndex={0}` (`docs/ui-primitives.md`, charter-app#186).
 *
 * `question.after_update` is charter-app#251's: Restart to update writes it into each record,
 * and the launch it restarts into says why it is being asked. "Reopen all" is in front either
 * way.
 *
 * Each project row carries its whole path as its title, for `calledOn`'s reason: two projects
 * can share a folder name.
