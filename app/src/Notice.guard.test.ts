/**
 * **Every standing line in the window is a Notice** (NO-1 #1223, rulings V91b, V91d, V91q).
 *
 * A Notice is a standing line about something true now (CONTEXT.md), and `Notice.tsx` is the
 * one way to draw one: its props will not take a line with no way out. Before it, each line was
 * a `<p className="came-back" role="status">` written by hand, and about thirty of the window's
 * messages left the operator reading a problem with nothing to press. This fails when one is
 * built that way again:
 *
 * - **a hand-built standing line**: any live region (a `status` or `alert` role, one picked by
 *   an expression, or `aria-live`) in any source file under `src/`, whatever its class. The
 *   ones that are not Notices (a dialog's refusal, a live count) are listed in `NOT_NOTICES`,
 *   each with why, by exact count per file, so a new one fails and a removed one is crossed off;
 * - **a hand-built way out**: a `dismiss` or `offer` button class, or a `notice*` class, named
 *   anywhere but `Notice.tsx`, or a stylesheet rule that draws `dismiss` or `offer`.
 *
 * And it **lists the debt** (V91q): every Notice whose only remedy is Copy command, a command to
 * type somewhere else. The list is `COPY_ONLY`, exactly, so adding to it is a visible change.
 *
 * Read as text, as `settings/oldFormClasses.test.ts` (DS-3e) and `paint.test.ts` read theirs:
 * jsdom computes no stylesheet, and a rendered window shows only the lines its test set up.
