/**
 * **The window's title bar**: the project strip on the left, what charter is on the right.
 *
 * ```
 * ● ● ●  [charter ²] [volaticloud] [▾ 3 more ¹] [+]  ···drag···  ✋2  About  ⟳
 * ```
 *
 * **ADR 0054 supersedes the operator's first spec for this bar**, which was a breadcrumb —
 * *"`{selected project name} / {selected workspace name} / {N sessions running}`"* on the
 * left and About and the update indicator on the right. The right-hand end is still his. The
 * left is the project strip now, because the bar is the window's row and the project strip is
 * the window's strip: `App` holds it for the window, not for a `PlaneView`. The crumb went
 * rather than squeezing in beside the tabs — the project tab in front says which project, the
 * workspace strip says which workspace, and a crumb repeating both spent the width the tabs
 * need. `N chats running` moved to the status line, which is per-project (`StatusLine.tsx`).
 *
 * # What gives way when the window is narrow
 *
 * **The right-hand end never does, and the project tabs give way before it**: the strip takes
 * what is left and collapses what it has no room for into its show-more menu, by the rules it
 * has always had (`fits.ts`, ADR 0039). Width the tabs cannot use is drag region, and **a
 * minimum stretch of it is always reserved** (`--title-bar-drag` in `App.css`), so a window
 * full of projects can still be grabbed. It is the strip's margin, outside the box the strip
 * measures, so the tabs are fitted to what is left after it and nothing here has to know it.
 *
 * # It is a title bar on macOS and a top row everywhere else, and that is not a gate
 *
 * `tauri.conf.json` asks for `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` with `hiddenTitle: true`. That is a
 * **macOS-only key**: there the system stops drawing a title bar of its own, leaves the
 * traffic lights floating over the webview, and this element IS the title bar — which is why
 * it reserves room for them on the leading edge (`title_bar_room`, and the constant lives in
 * Rust beside the `cfg!` that decides it). Windows and WebKitGTK ignore the key and go on
 * drawing their own title bar above the webview, so there this is the window's first row
 * instead, under the system's bar, with nothing reserved.
 *
 * **Nothing is gated, because the content is right either way.** The projects and what
 * charter is are worth a row on every platform; the only thing that differs is 78 px of
 * leading padding and which bar the operator thinks of it as. A `#[cfg]` that drew the
 * strip here on one platform and in a row of its own on another would be two windows to keep
 * in step, and the one it left out is the one charter is most often built for in CI.
 *
 * # It drags, and the parts that must not drag do not
 *
 * `data-tauri-drag-region="deep"` rather than the bare attribute. Tauri's handler
 * (`tauri/src/window/scripts/drag.js`) walks the composed path up from what was pressed: the
 * bare attribute drags only on a **direct** press of the element carrying it, which on a bar
 * made of text spans means the bar drags everywhere except on its own words. `deep` drags
 * anywhere in the subtree — and the same walk returns false at the first *clickable* element
 * it meets, where clickable is a `<button>`, a link, an `<input>`, an interactive `role`, or
 * anything carrying a `tabindex` other than `-1`.
 *
 * **Every control here is a `<button>`, and the TAG is what carries it.** `BUTTON` is in
 * Tauri's `CLICKABLE_TAGS`, so no attribute of ours is load-bearing for this: the `tabIndex={0}`
 * on About, the update item and the needs-you button (charter-app#249) is there for WebKit's
 * tab sequence (charter-app#186, charter-app#189), not for the drag. **The project tabs need no
 * drag rule of their own for the same reason**: each is a `<button>`, and so are its `×`, the
 * `+` and the show-more button. The strip itself carries a `tabindex` for its one Tab stop
 * (`roving.ts`), which the walk also stops at, so a press in a gap between its controls does
 * not drag either; the stretch after the strip does. A scenario written asserting a
 * `tabindex` on every control was refuted by the real app, which is how that came to be
 * written down here rather than assumed.
 *
 * **What no test here proves is that the window then moves.** WebDriver dispatches a
 * synthetic event and performs no default action (`docs/ui-primitives.md`), and a synthetic
 * `mousedown` that did reach Tauri's listener would end in an IPC call rather than an
 * observable drag. What IS proved, in jsdom and again in the shipped app, is the two facts
 * that handler reads: the attribute is on the bar, and every control inside it is an element
 * the handler stops at. `core:window:allow-start-dragging` — which `core:default` does NOT
 * include — is named in `capabilities/default.json` for the same reason: without it the IPC
 * call is refused and the bar is one the operator cannot grab.
