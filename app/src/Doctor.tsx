/**
 * **`charter doctor`, from inside the window** — the last of ADR 0038's named gaps.
 *
 * The case for it is one incident, and it decides the shape. A charter launched from Finder
 * could not find `claude`, because macOS hands a GUI app a four-directory `PATH`
 * (charter-app#134). The doctor was ported and would have said so — but it answers for the
 * process that runs it, and the only way to run it was a terminal, whose shell has the
 * operator's whole `PATH` and so cannot reproduce the thing being diagnosed. So the doctor
 * runs **in the app's process** (`app/src-tauri/src/doctor.rs`) and is drawn here.
 *
 * # Where it lives: the status line, as one button
 *
 * The status line is the frame, not a region (`StatusLine.tsx` argues it): always drawn, never
 * put away. That is the property a health indicator needs — a doctor in a region can be hidden
 * by the operator and then report nothing, which is the "absent answer read as health" charter
 * ADR 0013 forbids. And it is one button, not a row of counts, because what the line can carry
 * is a verdict; the rows themselves are a list, and a list is a dialog.
 *
 * # The verdict counts only what this build checked
 *
 * About twenty of the doctor's rows are WARNs that say *not checked (…)*, for checks this build
 * does not run (planned in OB-8, #994, and FG-2, #802). They are
 * drawn in the dialog — a doctor that dropped them would read as those problems being fixed —
 * but they are never COUNTED on the line: a count that includes them never goes below twenty,
 * and the one real warning among them is furniture on its first day. The core tells the two
 * apart (`Row::deferred`), so this does not guess from the wording.
 *
 * # One row is the app's own
 *
 * `charter doctor` answers about the plane. One question is about what THIS APP does when it
 * starts a chat — whether the chats it opens can record what a turn cost — and no CLI can
 * answer it, so the core hands it over beside the table (`DoctorReport.app_rows`). It is
 * counted with the rest, because it is a check this build runs and a warning an operator can
 * act on; the dialog draws it under its own heading so nobody goes looking for it in
 * `charter doctor`'s output.
 *
 * And the footer's rule holds: **zero draws nothing.** A clean doctor is the word `Doctor` with
 * no number — never a green tick, because about twenty checks did not run and a tick over them
 * would be the claim ADR 0013 exists to refuse.
 *
 * # Two depths
 *
 * The window runs the **preflight** when a project opens — what every session start already
 * runs, so asking it unprompted costs nothing new. Opening the dialog runs the **full**
 * doctor, which also probes each harness profile: that RUNS the harness, and the core says
 * only a doctor a person asked for may (`doctor/profiles.rs`). Opening the dialog is the
 * asking. The dialog says which of the two it is showing.
 *
 * # Fix
 *
 * A row charter can fix itself carries a fix id (`DoctorRow.fix`, FX-1), and the dialog draws a
 * Fix button for it. The button calls the same core entry point `charter doctor --fix <id>`
 * does, says what the fix changed or why it was refused, and then checks again, so the row is
 * redrawn from what is true after the fix rather than assumed fixed.
 *
 * A fix that takes input (`git-identity`, FX-3) opens its form under the row instead, and is
 * applied when the form is sent: see `GitIdentityForm.tsx`.
 *
 * A finding whose fix id is in `FINDINGS_AS_NOTICES` also stands as a Notice under the strip
 * (`DoctorNotices`, #1250), and the Notice's Fix does what the row's does: the same form, the
 * same check again, so the Notice goes when the doctor no longer finds it.

 *
 * - `git-identity` (`git identity`): without it every commit purlis makes (memory, notes,

 * - `memory-optimize` (`memory indexes`): a memory its `MEMORY.md` does not list is never read

 *
 * And why each of the others stays in the dialog:
 * - `discover`, `rename-plane`, `rename-local`, `persona-agents` and `handoff-rule` run only by
 *   their name (`by_name_only` in core doctor/fix.rs): the network, this machine's folders, or
 *   committed files every teammate pulls. One press under the strip is not how those are asked.
 * - `plugin-install` is about the chats started outside the app; the app arms its own either
 *   way, and the doctor the window runs at open reports the row as fine.
 * - `reinit` creates a missing baseline folder, which blocks nothing in the meantime.
 * - `local-ignore` is found only by the doctor the dialog runs: the one at open does not ask
 *   git, so its report would let the Notice's dismissal go while the finding stands.
 * - `workspace-reinit` (`workspace layout`, #1289; D-1301-2): a workspace behind the layout
 *   still opens and works, so it blocks nothing, and the Alerts drawer already stands it as its
 *   `reinit` row with the same fix. A Notice as well would say one finding in two standing
 *   places.
 *
 * Each by the name of the doctor row that finds it: a clean row carries no fix id, so the name
 * is how a report says the finding has gone (and a dismissal of it is let go).
