/**
 * A show-more button carries the needs-you count of what it hides (ADR 0054, charter-app#392).
 *
 * **The operator's constraint, stated before anything else was settled: hiding a workspace
 * must never hide a chat that needs you.** A strip that draws only some of its workspaces or
 * projects puts the rest behind its show-more button, so that button is now an attention
 * surface as well as an overflow — and a defect that hides its count hides a chat that is
 * waiting. The record asks for the count to be tested in its own right, not as a side effect
 * of the tab counts, and these are those tests.
 *
 * Against the whole `App`, observed only through what the operator reads: the button's words
 * and the rows of its menu. What the strips measure is stubbed, because jsdom lays nothing
 * out (#149): each strip answers `clientWidth` by its own name, and a strip nobody sized
 * answers zero, which draws everything.
