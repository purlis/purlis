 * (#1489, V100-74): shows it inside its session's tab, or opens it in a tab of its own.
 *
 * **Kept in the layout file, beside the text sizes and your editor** (`layout.json`,
 * `regions.ts`), under `chats`. It is how one person likes their window, on this machine: a
 * project would carry it to every clone. Each field falls back on its own, as every field of
 * that file does, and a value that is not one is the default's, said in the Inbox.
