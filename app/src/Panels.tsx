/**
 * One view of the right region: **what is asking for you** (ADR 0038).
 *
 * # One view at a time (#1678, ADR 0038 as amended 2026-10-10)
 *
 * The region was a stack of every panel. It is an activity bar's views now, one shown at a time:
 * Todos, Memory, Personas, Sessions and Vaults, then each approved extension's panel as a view of
 * its own, so a stranger's panel never crowds purlis's. `RegionFrame` draws the bar and keeps
 * every view mounted; this draws what one view holds — the one panel it is named for, with the
 * same heading, list and menus the stack gave it. {@link attentionPanels} says which extensions'
 * panels there are, which is what puts their tabs on the bar.
 *
 * **Alerts are not here any more, and that is a correction to ADR 0038, not an omission.** It
 * put them on this side, and this side is one project's: it follows the project in front and
 * the workspace focused in it. An alert is about a PLANE — a pin, a front door, a workspace's
 * layout, a plane root being worked in — and the plane that has one is usually not the one on
 * screen. So the window reads every project's alerts, and each project's Inbox lists its own
 * as Notices and names the other projects that have some (`InboxAlerts.tsx`, #1695).
 *
 * # What changed: this file stopped being the panels and became the thing that draws them
 *
 * The workspace's todos and the plane's personas, and **neither is written here**. They are
 * *contributions* — `purlis_core::panel` values produced in `app/src-tauri/src/panels.rs` and
 * drawn by the loop below, through the same seam an extension's declared panel arrives on. This
 * component knows what a panel is; it does not know what a todo is.
 *
 * That is the point, and it is testable rather than aspirational: an approved extension's panel
 * appears in this region with a search box, a bound, a load-more and a card on every row,
 * because `PanelList` gives every list those and this file gives every panel a `PanelList`.
 *
 * **The needs-you queue is not here any more** (charter-app#249). It sat above every panel,
 * because ADR 0038 says nothing in this region may compete with it — and then it left the
 * region altogether, for the title bar: this region is one project's and one workspace's, and
 * the queue is every project's. `NeedsYou.NeedsYouMenu` is where it is.

 * **charter's own keep the bare name they have always had** — `panel-todos`,
 * `panel-personas` — because a scenario spec is a contract with the window and renaming one to
 * advertise an internal move is a change to what the spec is about. A contributed panel is
 * `panel-ext-<extension>-<id>`, which cannot collide with a built-in's because `ext` is not a
 * legal panel id (an id starts with a letter or a digit and `charter/` is stripped, so the one
 * name this could clash with is a built-in panel called `ext-…`, and charter has none).
