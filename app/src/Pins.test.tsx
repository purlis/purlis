 * project's pin and a workspace's go in the machine store; a chat's goes in the plane's own
 * app record. A design that treated "pin" as one feature would pass a test that only ever
 * pinned one kind of thing, so every one of the three is driven here, end to end, through
 * the surface an operator uses — which is the palette, because that is where the rows are.
 *
 * What a pin DOES is draw the thing first on its strip. That is the assertion in each case,
