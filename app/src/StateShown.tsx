 * **A state as a row shows it: its mark, then its word** (#1484, V100-3, V100-72).
 *
 * The word is always drawn, and it is the text: what a person reads is what a screen reader
 * reads, and the mark beside it is decoration. The colour is on the mark and never on the
 * word, which stays legible whatever a theme does with the state colours. A state that needs
 * you wears the hand the title bar's list wears, **and the hand knocks twice when the chat
 * starts needing you** (`arrived`): only on that change, never because a row was drawn.
 *
 * **The knock is played once per change** (#1499). The Chats list moves its rows, and an
 * element put back into the document plays its animation again, so a class left on for good
 * would knock for a chat that has needed you for an hour each time another row moved past it.
 * The class comes off when the animation ends, and goes on again at the next change.
 *
 * `changed` is for a row drawn for the first time in a state its chat came into while the row
 * was not on screen: a task that started needing you under a session that had folded by
 * itself. It did change, and nothing here saw it, so the list says so.
