/**
 * **A chat's finished tasks, under its row in the Chats section** (#1485).
 *
 * A task ends at its report, and its row stays here as a finished entry. The ones that came
 * out done, and the ones the asking chat cancelled, fold into one line, **Finished (n)**, with
 * **Clear finished**. Every other end is a row of its own until it is cleared, so a failure is
 * never behind a count.
 *
 * **A task that did not start is one of those rows** (#1497): failed, with the reason shown
 * under it at once, as text. It is never a banner across the window. One the chat that asked
 * tried more than once is one row, which says how often.
 *
 * **A task a launch could not start again is drawn here too, and is not ended** (`waits`): it
 * is still recorded and is tried again at the next launch. Its row offers Try to start again,
 * Review and approve… where its profile waits on that, and End task, which is the only thing
 * that ends it. It has no Reopen and no Clear.
 *
 * **A finished task cannot be typed into**: its program has ended. Pressing its row shows its
 * report, in place, **as text**: every word of it is a text node, so nothing a task wrote is
 * ever read as markup. **Brief** shows what it was sent, from the same record (#1494).
 * **Reopen** resumes its conversation as an ordinary chat with a tab; it is then no longer a
 * task, and the chat that asked is told nothing.
 *
 * **Changes** opens what the task changed, and no other task's, in a tab of its own (#1511,
 * V100-66); **Review changes** for a task that worked on its own branch, whose tab offers the
 * person's Merge and Discard. The report's line about what changed opens the same tab.
 *
 * **A row has a menu** (#1534): for a task on its own branch, the catalogue's Merge… and, under
 * the line, Discard branch…, which ask the Changes tab's own questions.
 *
 * Not rows of the tree: there is no chat behind one to bring forward, so the arrows stop on the
 * chats and Tab reaches these, each a button of its own.
