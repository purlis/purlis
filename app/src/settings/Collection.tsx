/**
 * **A collection, drawn** (ST-3, V91e–g): each entry a heading with its Remove over its own rows,
 * then Add, which opens an inline form of setting rows. Every write is the driver's `entry`
 * (`driver.ts`), which asks the core's one function for the collection against the text the
 * entries were drawn from (`collection.base`); nothing is checked here, and every label is the
 * core's. What the core refuses is said where it belongs: a field's refusal under that field, a
 * Remove's referrers under the entry (by its identity) with a link to the group each is changed
 * in, or to where it is changed at another level (a persona's tab, #1241), an Undo's at the head
 * of the collection. The last add or remove offers its Undo at the head, saying what it did.
 *
 * **An entry with a page of its own** (ST-4, V91e: a harness profile) is drawn on its
 * collection's group as a heading that opens the page, with its Remove; the page draws that entry
 * alone, its rows and its Rename, with no Add. **Rename** (V91k) opens a one-field form in place;
 * a name the core refuses is said under it, and what uses the entry under the entry, as for a
 * Remove. When every user follows a rename (#1380), that is said as what a rename everywhere
 * would change, before anything is written, and the form offers Rename everywhere: one write.
 *
 * **Open chats that run on the entry** (#1290, a collection that counts them: the profiles) are
 * said before a rename or a remove, by count: they keep running, and the next launch cannot
 * start them again under a name the collection no longer has. Remove asks first where any
 * runs on it, and stays one press where none does; the Rename form says it as it opens.
