/**
 * **Settings** (SE-16, #1166; the spec on #558, rulings V89a–i): the one tab where a setting is
 * read and changed, one level at a time (`CONTEXT.md`, **Settings** and **Level**). A view tab
 * (`tabs.settingsView`), opened from the app menu's Settings…, `⌘,` and the palette.
 *
 * **Two columns.** The level switcher and what that level is sit at the top; the left nav lists
 * the level's groups; the right column shows the chosen group and nothing else. **You**; where
 * the tab is in a project, **Project** (SE-17); and where it is about a workspace — opened at
 * one, or on its strip — **Workspace** (SE-20) are offered. Persona joins the switcher as its
 * groups land, declared as data the same way (`groups.ts`).
 *
 * **The level is the tab's** (D-SE17a): the tab is keyed by it, and the switcher asks for the tab
 * to show another level (`onLevelChange`) rather than keeping one of its own — so opening
 * Settings at a level whose tab is open brings that tab forward, whichever level it was opened
 * at.
 *
 * "Preferences" was this tab's You level before it had a name (charter-app#283), and is retired.
 * So is the long Project settings page with its Form / Raw TOML switch (charter-app#252, SE-19):
 * its forms are the Project level's groups, and its raw view is the level's **Edit as TOML**
 * link per file (`RawToml.tsx`).
