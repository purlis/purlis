/**
 * **The settings driver** (SE-17's, generalised for SE-20): what every level whose settings are
 * kept in files shares — the Project level's `charter.toml` and `charter.local.toml`, the
 * Workspace level's `workspace.json`. A level says how its files are read, how one is written
 * and what it asks again once one changed; the driver does the rest, the same way for each:
 *
 * - **each change is written as its own keys**, through the core, one write at a time and each
 *   against the file as the last one left it; a write that would change nothing is not sent;
 * - **the last change can be undone**, by writing back exactly the keys it wrote (taking out a
 *   key that was absent), unless a value it would write back is one only the file can hold;
 * - **a refused write is kept by its setting**, in the core's words, and the files are read
 *   again so what is shown is what is on disk;
 * - **a file changed outside the tab** — by hand, by a chat, by another page — is read again, in
 *   the queue, so the next write is made against it rather than refused as changed on disk;
 * - **a value can be reset** (SE-18): its keys are taken out of the file it comes from, so the
 *   value beneath shows through — undone like any change;
 * - **a value can be moved** between a level's two files (SE-18, the Project level's "Shared /
 *   Only on this machine"), both files or neither, through the core. A move is made on a button
 *   and has no Undo; it ends the last change's Undo, whose keys it may have moved;
 * - **a file's whole text** (Edit as TOML, SE-19) is written in the same queue, against the
 *   text its edit began from; once written it is what the next change is made against, and the
 *   last change's Undo is gone, so an Undo never writes a key back over the text;
 * - **an entry of a collection is added or removed** (ST-3, the collection write seam) through the
 *   core's one function for that collection, which checks the whole entry and answers by field, by
 *   what uses the entry, and for the whole file ({@link EntryRefusal}). **It is sent against the
 *   text the entries were drawn from** ({@link EntryOp}'s `base`, taken when the person pressed
 *   the button), never the text as it stands when the write's turn comes, so a remove queued
 *   behind another write is refused rather than made to the entry now in its place. **Its Undo**
 *   (D-ST3-i, as amended) is what the level answers ({@link EntryUndo}): an add is undone by the
 *   inverse operation through the same core function — a remove of what was added, refused for
 *   what uses it — and a remove by writing the file's text back exactly as it was, against the
 *   text the remove left, so the entry is back where it was, as it was spelled, with its comment.
 *
 * **Nothing here loosens what the level says may not be loosened**: its `mayUndo` is asked of
 * every Undo, every reset and every move, and one it refuses is not offered (D-SE17g).
