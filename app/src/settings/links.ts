 * **Deep links into Settings** (SE-22, #1172; the spec on #558, V89c). A group's stable id
 * (`groups.ts`: `project.saving`, `you.editor`) is its address: anything that tells a person to
 * change a setting — a doctor row, a notice — names the group, and following it opens Settings
 * at that group's level with that group shown.
 *
 * **The group is not part of the view** (D-SE22a). The Settings tab is keyed by its level and
 * target (`tabs.settingsView`, `tabs.workspaceSettingsView`), so a link to a group of a level
 * whose tab is open brings that tab forward rather than opening another. Which group a tab
 * shows is held here instead, per level and target — a **place** — for as long as the window
 * runs: the group last looked at there, or the one a link last landed on. That is also how
 * each level remembers its last group (V89b, user story 31), and why it is not written to the
 * launch's record: it is this session's, not the tab's.
