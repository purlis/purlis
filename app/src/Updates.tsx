/**
 * **"An update is available", and the pin that drifts** — the two version facts charter ADR
 * 0038 left with no surface, drawn on the status line.
 *
 * # The update offer
 *
 * The updater (#158, ADR 0042) checks on its own and installs only on a click, and its
 * author named this file's job: listen for `update://checked`, show the offer, call
 * `installUpdate()` from it, and show `updateChannel()` / `setUpdateChannel()` beside it.
 *
 * **What installing costs is said before the click, never after it.** Every session is a child
 * of this process (ADR 0025). On Windows the installer ends charter at once; on macOS and Linux
 * the new version is put in place and runs from the next start — and starting it again means
 * ending this one. Either way the running chats end, and the offer says so.
 *
 * **Once it is installed the line says Restart to update** (charter-app#251), and that is the
 * way to finish. The core writes every project's record, saying a restart to update wrote it,
 * ends the chats and restarts; the launch after it asks #250's question — reopen every session
 * or start fresh — with "charter restarted to install an update." in it and Reopen all in
 * front. **A chat that is mid-turn is named first**, in the words the quit warning uses, with
 * Wait as the answer a stray Return finds. Nothing here restarts charter behind the
 * operator's back.
 *
 * **A check that failed on its own is not drawn.** The timer runs every few hours whether or
 * not the laptop is on a train, and a line that turned amber every time Wi-Fi dropped would be
 * furniture by Friday. A failure is drawn only after the operator asked for something — a
 * check, an install, a channel change.
 *
 * # The pin
 *
 * Only when `charter version` says the plane's `[charter] version` is one this charter does not
 * meet — and that verdict is `adopt::version_report`'s exit status (`app/src-tauri/src/pin.rs`),
 * never a comparison made here (ADR 0030, as amended by ADR 0045). Its dialog carries `charter version`'s own
 * sentences.
