/**
 * **The asks registry, as the window holds it** (#1690, spec #1688): everything that waits on
 * the person in each project, and how each is answered.
 *
 * The core derives a project's list from every source that waits today (`asks_waiting`): a
 * permission prompt held on a chat's hook, a dispatch held for a grant, a host a chat's sandbox
 * refused, a prompt in a harness's own terminal, a chat waiting on the person's reply. It keeps
 * no store, so the window reads the list again whenever one of those may have moved, and an
 * ask leaves it the moment its source stops waiting, wherever it was answered.
 *
 * **Answering goes through the path the ask names** ({@link answerThrough}): the command that
 * source's own Notice answers with, checked and audited as it is there. The registry adds no
 * route of its own. Every one of those commands is the window's alone.
 *
 * **What an ask says is data**: its chain of names, its line, a host. The window draws each as
 * text; none of it is ever markup or a control.
