 * A second theme is only proof that the contract works if it is a theme somebody could

 * inverting a dark one passes every other test in this directory while being unreadable.
 * So each pair of tokens that ends up as text on a background is held to a contrast ratio.
 *
 * **WCAG 2.1 AA is 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text and for a control's own
 * outline.** The window's text is 14px, so body text is held to 4.5. The chat-state marks are
 * dots and chips rather than prose and are held to 3, which is the ratio the standard gives
 * for a non-text thing that has to be distinguishable.
 *
 * This is a floor and not a target. It does not say a theme is nice; it says nobody shipped
 * one whose muted text vanished into its own background.
