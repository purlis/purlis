/**
 * **A branch's files, and one file of a branch** (RC-5, FM-2): the light editor's two view tabs.
 *
 * - **Files · \<branch\>** is the branch as a tree (`BranchTree`, the explorer's own file rows)
 *   beside a read-only preview of the file picked, with a divider between them that can be
 *   dragged or moved from the keyboard. Where it was left is the tab's (`tabs.splits`), and the
 *   record keeps it for a tab open at a quit (`reopen::View::split`). One tab for a whole
 *   branch, so reading through it does not leave a tab per file behind.
 *   A jump to a file at a line (a search hit, FM-8; `fileJump.ts`) lands here: the preview picks
 *   the file and brings the line into view, and the tree opens the folders above the file and
 *   scrolls to its row (#1137).
 * - **\<file\> · \<branch\>** is one file in a tab of its own: what the preview's *Open in a
 *   tab of its own* opens, and what a jump from a diff, a record or the knowledge graph opens.
 *
 * **The preview** (#1103 F4) draws code in the light editor, an image as an image, markdown
 * rendered (with its source a press away), and for a binary file or one past 2 MiB a sentence
 * with its size instead of its contents. Both tabs only read. The core names the folder from the
 * branch, refuses a path that leaves it, and decides what a file is by its bytes.
 *
 * **Show what changed** (FM-11) is beside a file the branch changed against its base, and only
 * there, in both tabs (#1189): it opens the file's comparison in a view tab of its own
 * (`PieceDiff.tsx`).
 *
 * **Copy path** and **Reveal** (#1143) are beside the file in both, as a tree row's menu has
 * them (FM-10): the core places the file, as it does for the row.
 *
 * **Open in your editor** (RC-20, ADR 0081 §3) is beside the file in both: the file and the
 * line the cursor is on go to the editor chosen in Settings. The window sends the
 * branch, the path, the line and which editor; the core checks the path as it checks a read,
 * and builds the URL or the program's arguments itself.
