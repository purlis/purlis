/**
 * **A dispatch to another persona that no grant covers, on the asking chat's tab** (#1437).
 * Nothing has started. The Notice says who wants to dispatch to whom and shows the first brief
 * whole, and the person answers once: **Allow for this chat**, **Allow for me on this machine**,
 * **Allow for everyone in this project**, **Keep blocked**, or **Never for this pair**. After an
 * Allow the dispatch starts, and so does every later one the grant covers, with no prompt.
 *
 * **The two ways to say no** (#1503). Keep blocked holds for this chat's life: it is refused at
 * once if it asks again, and a new chat is asked. Never for this pair is kept for the person on
 * this machine: no chat of that persona is asked or allowed for that target until it is lifted
 * in Settings. It is offered where the chat runs as a persona, since a chat on none has no pair.
 * No answer here grants "any persona": that is Settings' alone.
 *
 * **Where the project already grants it and the person has not answered that** (#1506), this
 * is the fallback for the Notice that said it arrived, which the person put away or missed. It
 * says the same thing in the same words (`arrivedSaid`), and for the pair it offers the same
 * two answers: **Accept**, in place of allowing it for everyone, since the project's settings
 * hold it already, and **Not on my machine**. Answering here clears that Notice, and answering
 * that one clears this. A project's "any persona" is said here with where it is accepted,
 * Settings: no Notice accepts it (V100-23). After Not on my machine the dispatch is still
 * held and this says so; the project's level is then not offered for the pair, which would
 * undo the answer by another name.
 *
 * **Where the list of nevers does not read, the Notice says so** (`never_unread`): no grant
 * counts until it does, which is why a pair already granted is asked about again.
 *
 * **It reads top to bottom as it is answered** (#1481, #1502): the sentence, then the ways out
 * in the order above, then what the asking persona wants besides and what the target works
 * with, then the brief in a box of about eight lines that scrolls. The brief is under the
 * buttons and never beside or above them: a long brief must not push the answer out of sight.
 * On a pane it is the first Notice, above what purlis only reports (`PaneFrame`).
 *
 * **Several pairs in one answer** (#1502). A persona's definition may say which personas it
 * usually works with. That grants nothing; it puts a box under the answers for each of them
 * nothing answers for yet, **unticked**, with what that persona works with beside it. An Allow
 * keeps the asked pair and every ticked one at the level pressed. Keep blocked and Never for
 * this pair are about the asked pair only, and send no box.
 *
 * **The boxes and the access lines are the core's, read from the project's own files.** The
 * window draws the names and sentences it is told and sends back only the names ticked and the
 * digest of what it showed (`shown`): the core reads the files again at the answer, and an
 * answer to a question that reads differently now allows nothing and is shown again, with every
 * box unticked: a tick is for the words it was made under. **The boxes never change in place
 * with nothing said**: when the core's list is read again while the question is up and it reads
 * differently, the Notice says so and every box is unticked. The boxes stand in alphabetical
 * order, which is the core's, so where one stands is not a persona file's to choose.
 *
 * **Allowing a dispatch is not allowing a secret**, and the Notice says so: what a persona's
 * chat does with a vault is asked as it was before.
 *
 * **It names the task and the profile** (#1456): the task's name is the chat's text, drawn
 * above the brief and apart from purlis's words, like the brief; the profile the persona's
 * chat would start on is the app's choice, said in the sentence. The target persona's mark
 * leads the line (#1454).
 *
 * **The brief is the chat's text, never purlis's.** It is drawn in its own block, under a line
 * that says so, as plain text: nothing in it is markup, a control or a sentence of the
 * Notice's. An Allow sends the held dispatch's number and the level, and nothing of the pair:
 * the core holds who asked, from its own record of the chat.
 *
 * **Policy has the last word**: a pair an administrator's policy locks is refused by the
 * dispatch decision before any question is held, so the app's dispatch path raises no Notice
 * for it; the chat is told the policy's sentence (#1456). Should a held question ever say it
 * is locked (`locked`), the Notice says so, with the policy's sentence and who set it, and
 * offers no Allow.
 *
 * **Where an Allow holds** (#1505), said on every question. At the project's root there is no
 * workspace to limit a grant to: the sentence says an Allow for the person or the project
 * holds in any workspace, and those two buttons say it too. Where the workspace is not there
 * yet (`works_in_missing`), nothing is kept: one answer, **Allow this one dispatch**. Where
 * the pair is already allowed in other workspaces (`allowed_in`), the sentence says so first,
 * which is why the person is asked again. Where the task works in a workspace (`works_in`), every
 * Allow is for work in that workspace only, and the sentence says so. Under the answers and
 * above the brief the person may choose **In any workspace** for the two wider Allows; the
 * narrower one is preselected, and each new question starts from it. The narrower Allow is
 * `allow_dispatch`, which the core limits by its own record of the task; the wider one is a
 * command of its own, `allow_dispatch_anywhere`. The window never sends a workspace's name.
