/**
 * What a machine that has never opened a project sees (FR-4, #603).
 *
 * **One question, and it is not where the plane goes** (W10). charter keeps a local project in
 * its own directory, with no remote, and the operator is asked only for the repo to work on.
 * That repo becomes a workspace named after it, and the first chat starts in its clone. The
 * copy is ADR 0072's: a code repo is a "repo", the plane is a "project", and the line that
 * says what a project is is the ADR's own. Sharing the project with a team comes later, and nothing here mentions accounts, cloud
 * or telemetry: none of them stands between a new machine and a working chat (G5, C2, B2).
 *
 * **What the machine has is shown, never asked about.** Which harnesses are installed and
 * signed in, and whether `gh` and `glab` are: a harness that is not signed in still starts, and asks for
 * its own login in its own first screen, which is where that question belongs.
 *
 * **Signing in to a forge is offered, not asked** (W10: "forge CLI auth detected and offered").
 * The first run comes before a repo is chosen, so which forge the project will use is not known
 * yet, and both CLIs are listed. A button beside a CLI's row, when it is installed and not
 * signed in, opens the local project and runs `<cli> auth login` in a shell tab there — the
 * CLI's own login, in a tab the operator can leave, so it adds nothing to the interrupt budget.
 *
 * **The project template is chosen here, and already chosen** (FR-17). It starts on the one that
 * fits the repo, which the core works out from the files at the repo's top level, so an operator
 * who does not look at it still gets one, and picking it costs no extra step. A template adds
 * personas, a review checklist and the commands every harness asks about first; it writes
 * nothing into the repo.
 *
 * The path box is there for the opener's reason: a native folder dialog cannot be driven by
 * the scenario tests, and an operator who knows the path types it faster than they click.
