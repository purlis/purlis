/**
 * Making a vault, asked where the answer is given — `NewWorkspace`'s shape, for `charter vault
 * add <name> --provider <provider>`.
 *
 * **This dialog validates nothing** but that the question has been answered: what a vault may be
 * called, whether one is already registered by that name, whether a plaintext file would be
 * committed — all of it is `vaultcmd::add`'s, reached through `vault_create`, so the window and a
 * terminal refuse the same things in the same words.
 *
 * **A 1Password vault is a short guided set-up** (#1527, {@link VaultSignIn}): how purlis signs
 * in, where the items live, a test, and then one step that registers the vault and stores its
 * token. That part talks to the core itself, because a token is handed over once and held
 * there, never here; it answers through `onMade` with the vault as it now is.
 *
 * **Drawn from the settings set** (DS-3c, #1175; ADR 0037's 2026-10-04 amendment): each answer
 * is a {@link SettingRow} holding a {@link Field} or a {@link Choice}, so its line of help is
 * the box's own description, and the dialog looks like every other place charter asks.
