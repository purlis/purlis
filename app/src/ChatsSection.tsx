/**
 * **The running chats of the focused workspace, in one tree** (#1447, #1655), in the left
 * region above the explorer. The explorer answers what is running at each place in this
 * workspace; this answers who is doing what, and which chat started which.
 *
 * **It follows the workspace in the strip** (#1655, ADR 0038's 2026-10-10 amendment): a tree is
 * listed where its top row works, with every task below it wherever that task works
 * (`chatsScope.ts`), and a chat started at the plane root is the root's. **A switch at the top
 * picks the scope** (#1679): This tab lists the chats of the tab in front, as the tab's chip
 * counts them; Workspace, the default, the focused workspace's; All, every workspace's. The pick
 * is kept for the project. A chat the scope leaves out that needs you is never left out
 * silently: the line under the filter names it and goes to it, as it does for one the filter
 * hides, and the title bar's queue lists it as ever.
 *
 * **A row is a way to the chat.** Pressing one, or Enter on it, shows its chat (`onOpen`, the
 * one way a row opens): a task has no tab of its own, and is shown inside the tab of the
 * session that asked for it (#1486). Space opens a task beside the session that asked for it,
 * inside that session's tab (#1489), and Delete on a task asks to stop it: both are rows of the
 * window's catalogue, and one that cannot run says why here.
 *
 * **At fifty chats** (#1499). The sessions that need you stand first, then the ones at work,
 * then the rest, and a session stands where the most urgent chat under it would; the chats
 * under a session stay in the order they were started. A session with chats under it is open
 * while one of them is not over, and folds by itself when all are, saying how its finished
 * tasks ended on its own row; **a fold set by hand wins** until it is set again. A filter over
 * the list finds a chat by its name, persona, workspace or state, keeps the rows above a match,
 * and says how many it hides. A row is one line, and the rest of what it knows is its card
 * (#1675, `Row`).
 *
 * **No row is moved under a resting pointer.** While the pointer is over the list, or the
 * keyboard is in it, the order, the folds the list makes by itself, the filter's answer and
 * the chats that arrive are held as they were, and are brought up to date when both have left,
 * or when the window stops being the one in use. A row is the same height whatever it comes to
 * say, and what the section says about the filter or a key has a line of its own that is
 * always there. What the person does themselves (a fold, a word typed in the filter) is
 * applied at once. **One thing is not held: a chat that ends.** Its row goes, and the rows
 * below it move up, because a row kept for a chat that is gone would be a way to nothing.
 *
 * **A chat that needs you is never filtered away silently.** Where the filter hides one, the
 * line under the filter says so and has a button that goes to it. And a filter opens every row
 * above what it found, whatever fold was set by hand, which is back when the filter is cleared.
 *
 * **A row says its chat's state by its mark, and the word in its card** (#1484, #1675):
 * `ChatShownState`, which the explorer's rows draw too.
 *
 * **The hand rolls up** (#1448). A chat that needs you wears it on its own row, as its state's
 * mark, and so does every row above it, where it is a button that goes to that chat. A row
 * with chats under it folds, and a folded row still wears the hand for what it hides, so a
 * fold never hides a chat that needs you. **A task that comes to need you opens the rows above
 * it** (#1675), once, whatever fold was set by hand.
 *
 * **A handoff is a row of its own at the top, never under the chat it came from** (#1492,
 * V100-69): the work moved, and its chat is a session with its own tab. Its card says `from
 * <chat>`, and that chat's card says `handed off to <chat>`; its menu goes there. Both name the
 * other chat as its own row does, so a rename is followed. **A task the person asked for
 * themselves is marked `asked by you`** in its card (V100-70).
 *
 * **A task that has finished stays under the chat that asked** (#1485), as a finished entry
 * and not a chat: its program has ended (`FinishedTasks`). They are drawn under their chat's
 * row, after the chats still running under it, and are hidden with them when the row is folded.
 *
 * **A row's menu stops its chat** (#1448): Stop, and Stop with everything below it, from the
 * window's one catalogue, as a tab's menu has them. **A task's has its own two rows instead**
 * (#1488): Stop and get its report, and Close now.
 *
 * **A chat moving redraws its own marks and no row** (SC-3). The rows are held, on plain
 * values, and each state mark reads its own chat's state, so fifty chats cost one mark per
 * move. The hands are read here from the queue, which keeps its identity until it changes, and
 * the order, the folds and the filter's answer are each read through the store's selector, so
 * the list is drawn again only when one of them changes: a reorder is the one thing that moves
 * rows.
