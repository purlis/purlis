/**
 * The command palette: every action the window can do, reachable by typing.
 *
 * **It is the primary input** (spec decision 1), and the tmux frame's `F2` before it. The
 * frame replaced a menu with it rather than putting one beside the other, because two
 * answers to "how do I do a thing" is how its single menu became weird in the first place —
 * so the bar's buttons here are not a second list, they are four rows of THIS one, drawn
 * permanently. `actions.catalogue` is the whole of the seam.
 *
 * **Keyboard first, and nothing in it needs a mouse.** `⌘K` opens it from anywhere, `F2` from
 * anywhere but a focused chat tab — where it is the platform's rename key (charter-app#254,
 * `theTabRenamesOnIt`) — and `Ctrl-K` from anywhere but a chat's own terminal (the rule is
 * below); typing narrows it, the arrows move over every row, Enter runs the one it is aimed at,
 * Escape leaves — and the focus goes back where it was, which for an operator mid-chat is the
 * terminal they were typing in.
 * A click selects and runs too; that is a convenience, not the path.
 *
 * **An unavailable row is listed WITH ITS REASON.** It is dimmed and `aria-disabled`, and the
 * reason is a visible sentence beside it rather than the dimming alone — the same rule M1.3b
 * set for chat state marks. Enter aimed at one runs nothing and says the reason.
 *
 * **The key it claims, it can hand back.** `F2` is taken on the window, capture-phase, so a
 * harness that wants `F2` never sees it — and used to have no way to (charter-app#47). A
 * second `F2` closes the palette and sends `F2` to the chat in front, which is `send-prefix`,
 * the idiom of the frame this app replaces. It is the catalogue's own `pane.sendkey` row that
 * runs, not a second path to the same thing, and the palette says so on screen the moment it
 * opens — a way out nobody can find is the same bug with more code in it.
 *
 * **And the rule that decides which keys it may claim at all** (charter-app#106):
 *
 * > A chord a terminal encodes belongs to the chat whenever a chat has the keyboard, unless
 * > the window claims it there deliberately — and a key claimed from under a focused chat
 * > must have a way to hand it back.
 *
 * Three keys, three answers out of one rule. `F2` is claimed from under the chat and has its
 * way back, which is what #47 bought. `⌘K` is claimed everywhere and takes nothing, because a
 * terminal sends nothing for it: xterm.js 6.0.0 answers a `⌘`-chord with `SELECT_ALL` for
 * `⌘A` and with no bytes at all for anything else. `Ctrl-K` is neither — a terminal encodes
 * it as `\x0b`, which is readline's kill-to-end-of-line in the shell every chat starts in, so
 * the chat keeps it and this listener stands back (`theChatKeepsIt`).
 *
 * **A refusal keeps the palette open, in the core's own words.** `purlis_core::worktree`
 * refuses a removal with a sentence naming the repair; the window does not reword it, does
 * not replace it with a generic failure, and shows it beside the rows rather than behind
 * them — the profile picker's rule, for the same reason: a refusal an operator cannot see
 * next to what they were doing is one they cannot act on.
 *
 * **It is the project switcher too** (FR-27), and that is one surface rather than two for the
 * reason the bar's buttons are rows of it: the box, the arrows, Enter, Escape and the keyboard
 * going back where it was are this component's, and a second dialog would be a second copy of
 * each. The switcher is the palette listing only `projects.rows` — the window's own
 * `Switch to project …` rows, the last project the operator was in first — under its own
 * name. It opens on its key (`switcherKey.ts`), on the title bar's button, and on the
 * palette's own `Switch project…` row, which turns the palette it is run from into the
 * switcher rather than closing it. **A further press of its key moves down one**, the way a
 * system's window switcher does, so the key and Enter go back to the last project and the key
 * twice and Enter to the one before that.
 *
 * **And it finds files** (FM-7, #1110; V86 F10): once something is typed, a "Files" group
 * follows the projects — a group of its own, never ranked into the projects' list (ADR 0079's
 * rule for a box that asks two kinds of thing). Its scope follows the window's focus, the
 * branch picked in the explorer, else the project in front, and Tab widens it a rung at a time
 * up to every open project (Shift+Tab narrows); the scope is said above the group. With files
 * to find, the key is the window's whenever a project is open, not only when there are two to
 * switch between, and a lone project's own row, which could only say it is already in front,
 * is not listed.

 * belongs to two different programs depending on who has the keyboard. Two predicates and not

 * says the wrong thing should be a defect in one of them rather than an ambiguity in both.
 *
 * **Only a `Ctrl` chord, and that is the whole of the rule** (charter-app#106). A terminal
 * encodes `Ctrl` with a letter as a C0 control byte — xterm.js 6.0.0 answers `Ctrl` plus a
 * key code in 65..90 with `String.fromCharCode(code - 64)`, so `Ctrl-K` is `\x0b`, which is
 * kill-to-end-of-line in readline and in every emacs-keys line editor. Swallowing it on the
 * window is taking an editing key out of the shell every chat starts in. `F2` is not here
 * because #47 already settled it the other way, with a way back; `⌘` is not here because
 * xterm.js sends nothing at all for a `⌘`-chord but `⌘A`, so there is nothing for the window
 * to be taking.
 *
 * **Where it landed, not where the focus is.** A capture listener on the window runs before
 * the focus has any say, and `e.target` is the element the keystroke was delivered to — which
 * inside a pane is xterm's own textarea, a descendant of the marked holder. An undispatched
 * event has no target and is therefore nobody's: that is the palette's, which is what makes
