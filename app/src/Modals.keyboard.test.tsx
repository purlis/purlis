/**
 * **What a keyboard can reach in each of the window's modal surfaces — one file, because the
 * answer was decided once for the window** (charter-app#186).
 *
 * Two mechanisms decide where Tab goes inside a Radix modal, and the defect lives in the gap
 * between them.
 *
 * - **Radix's `FocusScope` handles the two EDGES of the scope and nothing else**
 *   (`@radix-ui/react-focus-scope`, `handleKeyDown`): on the first tabbable it acts on
 *   Shift+Tab and calls `focus(last)` itself, on the last it acts on Tab and calls
 *   `focus(first)`. In between it does not touch the event.
 * - **In between, the engine decides — and the engine is WebKit**, a WKWebView on macOS and
 *   WebKitGTK on Linux, because charter embeds the system WebView. WebKit leaves a form
 *   control out of the tab sequence unless macOS's full keyboard access is on. That is not a
 *   quirk of one runner: it is `HTMLFormControlElement::isKeyboardFocusable`, and it was
 *   measured in the real window in charter-app#176 before it was read in the source.
 *
 * So a `<button>` that is neither edge is reachable by neither, and every control in these
 * dialogs is a `<button>` — including Radix's checkbox and its radio rows, which render
 * `Primitive.button` rather than an `<input>`.
 *
 * **The fix is the engine's own escape hatch and not a handler of ours.** WebKit's rule, in
 * full, since r263447 (`[popover] Improve focus handling`, 2023-04-29, shipped in Safari 17
 * and WebKitGTK 2.42):
 *
 * ```cpp
 * bool HTMLFormControlElement::isKeyboardFocusable(const FocusEventData& focusEventData) const
 * {
 *     if (!!tabIndexSetExplicitly())
 *         return Element::isKeyboardFocusable(focusEventData);
 *     return isFocusable() && document().frame()
 *         && document().frame()->eventHandler().tabsToAllFormControls(focusEventData);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **A `tabindex` that is written down is not consulted against full keyboard access at all.**
 * That is why Radix's radio rows were always reachable — roving focus writes one on them — and
 * why nothing else was. Every button in a modal now says `tabIndex={0}`, which is the
 * platform's answer rather than charter's, and leaves the primitives' own behaviour untouched
 * (ADR 0037). `docs/ui-primitives.md` holds the reasoning.
 *
 * **Why this is measured here and not in a scenario — which was tried, in a real window, and
 * cannot be done.** The obvious objection to this whole file is that jsdom is not WebKit, so a
 * spec was written to walk the picker with `browser.keys(["Tab"])` and read
 * `document.activeElement` — an unmodified key and a DOM read, neither of which runs into what
 * charter-app#176 measured. It reported that Tab reached nothing at all, including the radio
 * rows, which have carried an explicit `tabindex` from Radix's roving focus since long before
 * this change and were never in doubt. That was the tell. Two plain text `<input>`s injected
 * into the running app settled it: **Tab does not move the focus between them either**, while
 * the keydown arrives unprevented. This driver dispatches a synthetic DOM event and performs no
 * default action of any kind, which is one fact wearing the three faces #176 caught it in.
 * `docs/ui-primitives.md` has the trace.
 *
 * So a scenario can neither confirm nor refute reachability, and the half it CAN prove is kept
 * in `picker.e2e.ts`: that the attribute the engine's rule needs survives the build and is on
 * the element in the shipped app, which is the one thing jsdom cannot see. What is left
 * unproven anywhere is the step between the two — that WebKit, handed the attribute, then tabs
 * to it. That is `inWebKitsTabSequence` (`tabSequence.ts`), it is read from the engine's source rather than
 * measured in a running one, and it is the one assumption in this file worth attacking.
