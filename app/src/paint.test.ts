/**
 * **What a chat draws once per chat is cheap to paint** (#891, FR-27's L9).
 *
 * A project with fifty chats lists fifty rows in its Chats list, each with a state mark, and the
 * same marks sit on its tabs. On CI's software-rendered WebViews those rows were most of what
 * the first switch into such a project cost: an `opacity` below 1 gives each element its own
 * transparency layer to paint and blend, a row's layer held its mark's layer inside it, and a
 * dashed round border is stroked dash by dash. So the dimming is mixed into the colour instead,
 * and the ring that says `unknown` is two solid arcs rather than a dashed circle.
 *
 * jsdom computes no stylesheet, so this reads the rules as text, as `overscroll.test.ts` does —
 * **every** rule whose selector list names one of these, wherever it is in the file and however
 * it is grouped, `@media` blocks included.
