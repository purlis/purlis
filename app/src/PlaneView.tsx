/**
 * One project, with everything that belongs to it.
 *
 * **This is the extraction ADR 0033 costed and #121 named as what it was leaving behind.** The
 * window used to BE the project: one `App` held the tabs, the sidebar, the panels, the chat
 * states, the picker and the palette, so a second project had nowhere to put any of them and
 * the app could draw exactly one. Here a project holds its own, and the window holds projects.
 *
 * **A project that is not in front keeps everything and draws nothing.** It stays mounted and
 * returns `null`: its tabs, its splits, its focused workspace and its picker are React state
 * that simply is not rendered, and its `useChats` goes on listening, so the project tab
 * can say a chat over there needs you. That is the operator's own reason for wanting one
 * window per project in the first place — fifty chats in project A must not be torn down
 * because he glanced at project B.
 *
 * It draws nothing rather than being hidden with CSS: a hidden
 * `[data-strip="Tabs"]` is a second tab strip for every query in this app and
 * in the scenario tests to trip over, and a hidden pane is a terminal being fitted to a box
 * with no size.
 *
 * **And not kept drawn under React's `<Activity mode="hidden">` either** (FR-27, #620). It was
 * prototyped around this view's chrome only, on CI: the switch it was meant to speed up moved
 * by less than CI's own spread from run to run, and what it costs in memory was not settled by
 * the one reading taken. What a switch costs is drawing this view and starting the pane's
 * terminal; what is kept small instead is the drawing again after that first draw
 * (`fits.useRoom`, `saving.ts`, `projectTheme.ts`).
 *
 * **The palette is the window's, not a project's**, for the same reason turned round. It has
 * to be mounted before the core has said which project this launch opened — `F2` is a
 * keystroke it listens for itself — and mounted once, because it claims that key on the
 * window with a capturing listener. So what it lists travels up from here with the rest of
 * this project's report, and the window draws the one palette.
 *
 * Its panes come and go with it, and that costs a project nothing: only the tab in front has
 * panes on screen anyway (`tabs.ts`), the core has held every session's terminal all along,
 * and a view opened again is sent the screen as it already is.
 *
 * **Held (`memo`), so the window redrawing is not this view redrawing** (SC-3). Every chat move
 * reaches the window as this project's report — the quit warning's states, the project strip's
 * order — and the window redraws for it; a project view drawn again for that, with the same
 * props, would be every tab and pane redrawn for one chat's move.

              two strips now hold the same two things and a second class name would be a
              second place to dress them.

              **The `+` is the operator's, and it is drawing a control over a row that was
              already there** — *"also no new workspace button in workspaces tab — it should
              be like projects tabs buttons"* (charter-app#193). `workspace.create` has been in
              the catalogue since #172, with the dialog behind it; the palette runs it and the
              tab's own menu lists it, and the one strip that is entirely about workspaces had
              no way to make one. Nothing here knows what it does: it is one `Doer` over that
              row, so its words, its availability and its refusal are the catalogue's, exactly
              as they are in the other two surfaces that offer it.

              **`Plus`, which is the chat strip's glyph and not the project strip's pair.**
              charter-app#178 split `project.open` and `project.create` into `FolderOpen` and
              `FolderPlus` because that strip draws two of them an inch apart and one glyph on
              both is a strip aimed at by memory. There is one control here, and the rule it
              falls under is the older one: the `+` at the end of a strip makes one more of

            project strip's `+` and true of this one too. Its accessible name is still the
            catalogue's `New tab`, which is what a screen reader reads and what

            whole of why those moved; `New tab` acts on the strip and there is one of those.

            the `+` at the end of a strip makes one more of what the strip lists.

            The argument is the one he gives. All three act on THE FOCUSED PANE, and with a
            window split four ways the bar gives no sign of which that is: the operator reads
            the layout, works out where the keyboard went last, and presses a button somewhere
            else entirely. A control on the pane names its own target.

            They are still catalogue rows and still in the palette, which is what a keyboard
            without a pointer uses: the palette acts on the focused pane, and a pane's own

            bottom status bar — again like ZED"*. The rule is unchanged and travels with them:
            one button per region in the arrangement, in the order the window draws them.

 * folder*, and `project.create` is the row that writes a directory that was not there; opening

 * `project.open` wore `FolderPlus` only because it was the strip's one control when #171 drew
 * it — two icon-only buttons an inch apart carrying one glyph is a strip an operator has to
 * aim at by memory.

 * **`workspace.create` and `chat.new` share `Plus`, and that is the rule rather than an

 * own strip, a whole row apart from the other, and what both mean is the same thing: make one

 * at finding than any menu will be. This lists what the strip is hiding and nothing else, so
 * that the strip has an affordance saying there is more — which a scrollbar never was.
 *
 * **Sorted by last activity — here, and nowhere else.** The strip's own order never moves
 * (`tabs.ts`), because a tab that moves under the cursor breaks aiming. A menu is a list you
 * read rather than a surface you aim at, and the boundary between the two rules is exactly
 * whether the thing moves under your hand.
 *
 * **And it carries the needs-you count of everything it hides** (ADR 0054). The operator's
 * constraint was that hiding a workspace must never hide a chat that needs you, so the
 * button draws the sum of its rows' counts in the red their own tabs draw it in, says it in
 * its name, and lists the rows that need you first. Nothing hidden is moved onto the strip
 * because it needs you: that would move tabs under the operator's hand, which is the one
 * thing ADR 0039 refuses, and the count and the title bar's ✋ menu already say it.

 * **After those, the caller's order**, which on all three strips is most recently moved first:
 * a tab by its chats' newest move, a workspace by its chats', and a project by the newest move
 * its `PlaneView` reports (`PlaneReport.moved`, charter#401).
 *
 * **Only rows that bring a tab forward.** Every row is the catalogue's `tab.select:<id>`,
 * which is the same row the tab itself is and the same row the palette lists. Nothing
 * destructive is in here: a tab's `×` sits under the pointer on a surface the operator chose
 * to open, and a menu that pops up under the cursor with `End chat` in it is charter-app#130's
 * defect with a mouse attached.

/**
 * The controls in a pane's top right corner: split it two ways, and end its chat.
 *
 * **The operator's, in his own words**: *"harnesses panes should each have close button and
 * spliting buttons in pane right top corner — and its visible when hovering harness only …
 * buttons should not have texts — only tooltips on hovering — so this will fully replace
 * separate buttons Split right, Split left, Exit this pane's chat buttons, and this will be
 * clear for spliting — user will know what pane is spliting."*
 *
 * **Three things he did not say, which the rest of this repo does:**
 *
 * - **A tooltip is not an accessible name.** `title` is what a pointer gets and a screen
 *   reader may or may not read it; `aria-label` is what a keyboard and `pressOnly()` find.
 *   Both carry the catalogue's own words, so there is still one place they are written down.
 * - **Hover-only is invisible without a pointer**, so these are drawn for the FOCUSED pane as
 *   well as the hovered one. `App.css` has the rule and the reason it is `visibility` rather
 *   than `opacity`: an invisible button that can still be clicked is `End this pane's chat`
 *   under a stray press.
 * - **The close is the danger colour**, as the tab's `×` and the bar's button were, because
 *   it does the same thing. It asks first now (`EndingChat`), which is new and is not a
 *   licence for it to look lighter.
 *
 * Every button is a row of the catalogue, and the row is the same one the palette lists.
 * Nothing is drawn for a row the catalogue no longer has.
