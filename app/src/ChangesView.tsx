/**
 * The Changes view: what the focused workspace's repos are doing (ADR 0038 as amended
 * 2026-10-10, #1676).
 *
 * Repo git state, worktrees and pipelines, which used to be two sections of the right-hand
 * side. They moved because the right-hand side is what is asking for you and this is not: it
 * is what is true, and nothing in it can be pressed. **They were the bottom region until
 * #1676** (B-7): the bottom took height from the terminals, so it became a view on the left
 * side's activity bar, beside Chats, Explorer and Search, and the bottom of the window is the
 * terminals'. Its tab counts the files git has uncommitted ({@link uncommitted}).
 *
 * ## It is a tree, an editor's source-control view (#1701)
 *
 * In a side the bottom bar's table scrolled sideways past every column it had. So each repo is
 * a heading — the repo and the branch its checkout is on — and what is true of it are rows
 * under it, in the order a person asks: what is uncommitted, which branches are cut off it (and
 * under that row, each branch), and what its pipeline last said; then a row per column an
 * extension adds. Drawn with the window's one tree style (`.tree`, #1672): a level is a
 * `role="group"` whose guide is a straight line, so the worktrees under a clone lost the bottom
 * bar's elbows (#1682). Nothing folds: a fold is a press, and every row is always drawn.
 *
 * **A row that names something is one line**, the explorer's rule, asked of both sides by the
 * operator: the view scrolls sideways rather than fold a name. A row that holds a SENTENCE — a
 * tree purlis could not read, a pipeline nobody fetched — still wraps, because held on one line
 * it would push the scroll out past everything else. `regions.e2e.ts` holds both halves, in a
 * real WebView, because jsdom lays nothing out. The one-line rule is `App.css`'s `.tree-row`, on
 * the row, and the sentence's own rule there still wins on the sentence, which it inherits from.
 *
 * ## The keyboard reads it; nothing in it is pressed
 *
 * **One Tab stop, and the tree's keys** (#1701): the WAI-ARIA "Tree View" pattern the explorer
 * is — Up, Down, Home and End from the roving focus (`roving.ts`), Right into a row's first
 * child, Left back to its parent, and type-ahead (`Explorer.treeKey`). The stop at rest is the
 * first row, which is where ⌃⇧G puts the keyboard (`giveViewTheKeyboard` lands on a tree's
 * stop). A row the keyboard is on is read, never run: Enter and Space do nothing here.
 *
 * **Read-only, and that is asserted rather than described** — `regions.e2e.ts` presses on
 * every control in here and expects to find none. A focusable row is not a control: it is what
 * lets the view be read and scrolled by keys. It is the one half of ADR 0038's reading ("the
 * bottom is where you read what is true and do not touch it", where "the bottom" is now this
 * view) that a test can hold.
 *
 * **A repo's rows have a context menu, and a menu is not a control** (charter-app#174). It is
 * the explorer's clone menu — `New tab in <repo>` and `Start new chats in <repo>` — drawn from
 * the same catalogue rows, now that the core says where a clone is (`Panels.paths`). It is on
 * the heading and on each row that is about the clone (its changes, its branches' count, its
 * pipeline, an extension's value); the menu is drawn in a portal outside this region, and none
 * of its rows touches the repo the region is reading: they are about where the next chat
 * starts. The keyboard opens it on the row it is on (Shift+F10, `Menus.openFromTheKeyboard`).
 *
 * **The worktree rows under each repo still have none, and that is a decision.** Their verbs
 * exist — `worktree.merge:<repo>/<piece>` and `worktree.remove:<repo>/<piece>`, drawn on the
 * explorer's rows — but putting `Remove worktree` under the pointer in the region ADR 0038
 * says is for reading is an amendment to ADR 0038, argued on its own, and not a defect fix.
 * A right-click there answers with nothing rather than with the browser's own menu, which
 * `useNoBrowserMenu` covers for the whole window.
 *
 * **A repo the workspace names and nobody cloned here has the explorer's Clone row as its menu**
 * (#1215), by the same argument as a clone's: a menu, drawn in a portal, and a clone adds a
 * folder beside the others without touching any repo this region reads. Its heading says what
 * became of the clone — under way, or failed in the core's words — as text, never a control.
 *
 * **Nothing here waits on a network.** The pipeline row is what a forge refresher last wrote
 * into `.charter/cache/glstate.json`; charter-app reads that file and never fetches. A row with
 * nothing to show says why, because a blank one reads as "green" to a person in a hurry.
 *
 * **The worktrees are a count and a list of branches, not the explorer's rows again.** They
 * are in two regions — ADR 0038 names that as the visible crack in its own rule — and the
 * least dishonest way to have them in both is to make each answer its own question: on the
 * left a piece is a thing you pick, here it is a branch that exists and may be unwired.

 * The mark for each of the seven words a pipeline may be in.

 * their own vocabulary onto it — so this is exhaustive rather than a guess, and anything the
 * cache holds that is not one of the seven gets the dashed circle, which is what charter
 * already draws for "there is a fetch here and it names nothing".
 *
 * **`running` and `pending` are the ones that move.** That is the whole of the operator's
 * "show pipelines with animation": those two are the states where nothing else on the row
 * distinguishes *this is happening now* from *this stopped and nobody said so* — amber and
 * the word "running" are equally true of a job that died an hour ago. Every other mark is a
 * settled answer and sits still, because motion beside a settled answer is only something to
 * look at.
 *
 * **And the two move differently, because they are different claims** (M7.2). `running` spins:
 * work is being done. `pending` is a clock that breathes: the run is alive and queued, and
 * nothing is being done yet. Both used to spin, which drew a queued pipeline as a working one —
 * the same lie the paragraph above is about, told the other way round.
 *
 * **A mark that arrives at an answer settles into it, once.** A pipeline that finishes while
 * the operator is looking has its new mark drawn in over `duration.settle`; one that was already
 * finished when the row was drawn is simply there (`useArrived`). Every one of these motions is
 * a theme token, and every one of them stops under `prefers-reduced-motion` in the one place
 * the motion layer handles it (`src/theme/motion.ts`); the word and the shape do not.
