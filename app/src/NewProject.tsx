/**
 * Making a new project — a plane charter scaffolds — and the one decision it asks about.
 *
 * **The prompt IS the prompt** (ADR 0035). The CLI's shape is `mkdir`, `cd`, `charter
 * init`, because a hook blocked on stdin hangs a turn and `util.py` reads none; here there is a
 * window and a person looking at it, so the directory is picked and the question is asked where
 * the answer is given. Nothing is copied from the printed two-command shape.
 *
 * **The default writes nothing into anybody's repository** (ADR 0035, spec decision 27).
 * `charter init` used to scaffold the plane into whatever directory it was run in, and offer to
 * clone that repo as the first one. The opener destroyed the case that rested on: a directory
 * chosen in a file dialog has nobody standing in it, and writing `charter.toml`, `personas/`
 * and a block of rules into a tracked `.gitignore` is a write nobody typed. So a directory that
 * is the top of a git repository is refused, in the core's own four-line sentence, which names
 * the plane-beside-it shape and the flag that asks for the old one.
 *
 * **"Make this repo itself the project" is that flag, as a box.** charter's own plane is a
 * repository, which is why the option is here at all — and it is never the default, and never
 * ticked for the operator.
 *
 * **Adopting a repository is the other half, and it is the one ADR 0035 calls the default**
 * (charter-app#175). The record's sentence is that `charter init` on an existing repo *"adopts
 * that repo as the plane's first clone and makes the plane beside it"*, so this asks for two
 * directories rather than showing a refusal about them: where the plane goes, and which repo
 * it starts with. The repo is cloned into `workspaces/<default>/<name>/` with charter's git
 * policy applied to the clone, and **nothing is written into the repo itself** — it is read,
 * and only read.
 *
 * The two answers are separate boxes because they are separate answers. Deriving the plane's
 * directory from the repo's (`../<name>-plane`) would put charter's guess where the operator's
 * decision belongs, on the one field this dialog exists to collect.
 *
 * Whatever is scaffolded is then opened **through the trust gate** — see `create_project`. A
 * plane charter has just made is still a plane this machine has approved nothing about, so the
 * ordinary end of this dialog is the approval dialog, on the same path a recents row takes.
 *
 * **All of the above is under Advanced now** (FR-4, #603, ruling W10). The default asks one
 * thing, the repository, and opens it into this machine's local project in a workspace named
 * after it — the first run's own path, so nobody is asked where a plane goes before they have a
 * reason to care. The two-directory form is a `<details>`, closed, because the browser has a
 * collapsible (`docs/ui-primitives.md`).
 *
 * **Every answer is drawn from the settings set** (DS-3c, #1175; ADR 0037's 2026-10-04
 * amendment): a {@link SettingRow} holding a {@link Field} or the box as a {@link Choice}, so a
 * line of help is its box's own description. A `Browse…` sits in its box's row, beside it.
