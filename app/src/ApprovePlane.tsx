/**
 * What opening this project will put in force, and the question about it.
 *
 * **The prompt IS the prompt** (ADR 0035). charter's CLI asks by printing a second
 * command to type, because `util.py` has nothing that reads stdin and a hook blocked on stdin
 * hangs a turn — a constraint about the CLI and about nothing else. Here there is a window and
 * a person looking at it, so the question is asked where the answer is given, and nothing is
 * copied from the CLI's printed-command shape.
 *
 * What it shows is what charter can enumerate, and no more: the plugins the project's
 * committed settings enable, the environment they set, the programs its reopen record would
 * start, and the tools each persona may run without a prompt. It does not and cannot summarise
 * the project's persona charters, its memory or its todos, which are text a model will read and
 * act on — charter has no model and makes no judgements about the content of work. Said on screen, in the last line, rather than left for
 * whoever first assumes the dialog covered everything.
 *
 * A project that has changed what it contributes asks again, and the changes are charter's own
 * words for them (`machine::Change`) rather than a second description written here. Which
 * changes re-ask and which are only reported is `machine::Consent`'s decision and is taken
 * before this is drawn: a dialog that is up is a dialog that has to be answered.
 *
 * A Radix dialog (`docs/ui-primitives.md`). "Has to be answered" was a claim about how it was
 * drawn; with the primitive it is a property of the surface — the window behind it is inert,
 * and the keyboard cannot reach past it to open the project some other way.
 *
 * **Escape answers it now, and did not before.** A modal with no way out on the keyboard is
 * the one thing a modal must not be, and the answer Escape gives is the same as Cancel's:
 * nothing is approved, nothing is opened, and the next ask is a first ask again. A click
 * outside is not an answer and does not close it — missing a dialog is not a decision.
