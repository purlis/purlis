/**
 * What charter asks before it ends a chat.
 *
 * **The operator asked for it in the same breath as the pane controls**: *"closing session
 * should ask confirmation"*. Until now the only guard was the words — `End chat 3 steward` on
 * the `×`, and a tooltip saying *"Ends the program it runs. There is no undo."* That was the
 * fix for charter-app#130, where a glyph reading "hide this tab" was ending live harnesses,
 * and it was the right fix for a *name*. It is not a guard against the press itself, and the
 * press is now one of several: a `×` on a tab, a `×` on a pane that appears under the pointer
 * on hover, and a row of the palette.
 *
 * **Every route through it, because there is one list of actions.** This is asked in
 * `PlaneView`'s `run`, which is what carries out a row from whichever surface pressed it — so
 * the palette's `End chat 3 steward` asks exactly as the tab's `×` does. A confirmation on one
 * surface and not another is the second answer this app's catalogue exists to not have.
 *
 * **Radix's `AlertDialog` and not its `Dialog`**, which is not a style choice: an alert dialog
 * is `role="alertdialog"`, it is announced as an interruption rather than as a surface, and
 * the primitive requires a `Cancel` that the focus goes to. The four dialogs in
 * `docs/ui-primitives.md` are questions the operator went looking for; this one arrives
 * *because of* something they did, which is the distinction the role exists for.
 *
 * The two house rules for a modal here are the four dialogs' (`docs/ui-primitives.md`), and
 * this primitive keeps both without being told:
 *
 * - **A click outside answers nothing.** The four `Dialog`s prevent `onInteractOutside` by
 *   hand; `AlertDialogContent` does not take the prop at all, because it refuses outside
 *   interaction itself.
 * - **Escape answers, with the non-destructive answer** — the primitive's own `Cancel`.
 *
 * And one that is this dialog's alone: **Cancel is first, and the focus starts on the answer the
 * operator ruled the default** (ADR 0064). Since Smart close there are three answers — Cancel,
 * Close, Smart close — and the focus goes to Smart close on a chat with turns behind it, to
 * Close on one that has had at most one turn (little to record), and to Cancel wherever
 * charter cannot say (`firstAnswer`). Before Smart close, Cancel was always focused; a stray
 * Return on a chat charter knows nothing about still cancels.
 *
 * **Every answer carries `tabIndex={0}`.** Radix's `FocusScope`
 * intercepts Tab only at the EDGES of the scope: on the first tabbable it acts on Shift+Tab and
 * moves the focus to the last itself, on the last it acts on Tab and moves to the first, and in
 * between it does nothing and the engine decides. **The engine here is WebKit on both platforms
 * charter ships to, and WebKit leaves a `<button>` out of the tab sequence** unless "tab to all
 * controls" is on — **or the button's `tabindex` is written down**, which is the whole of the
 * fix and is the engine's own rule rather than a workaround
 * (`HTMLFormControlElement::isKeyboardFocusable`; `docs/ui-primitives.md` cites the change).
 *
 * Until charter-app#186 this dialog was whole for a narrower reason: it had two tabbables and
 * the confirm was the second, so Cancel WAS the first edge and the confirm the last, and
 * Shift+Tab from Cancel was Radix's own `focus()` call rather than the engine's tab sequence.
 * That was a property of the *number of buttons*, and the third one Smart close added is why it
 * had to stop being one. `App.test.tsx` and `SmartClose.test.tsx` pin the order and the focus.
 *
 * **What the above is NOT is the reason a scenario cannot press these buttons**, and an earlier
 * version of this comment said it was. Measured in charter-app#176 with a keydown trace in the
 * real WebView: `Enter` on a focused `Cancel` arrives AT that button, unprevented, and does not
 * activate it — WebDriver key actions carry no implicit activation. That is the harness, not the
 * engine and not this dialog, and it is why the keyboard half of the claim is tested in
 * `App.test.tsx` and not in `palette.e2e.ts`. Two findings, one true of the product and one true
 * only of the test rig; keeping them apart is the whole point of writing them down.
