/**
 * **A chat that is not on screen is stopped on a prompt** (reported 2026-10-09): its harness
 * asked the person's permission for a tool call, or asked them something, in a terminal nobody
 * is looking at, and everything it does waits on that answer. Said on the pane of the tab it
 * lives in — for a task, its session's tab — naming whose it is by its whole path (`NoticeOf`),
 * with **Show the task**, which switches the tab to it.
 *
 * - **Only for a chat that is not on screen.** On screen, the prompt is in its own pane, and a
 *   second line about it would say it twice. So nothing is drawn where no `NoticeOf` is given.
 * - **From two sources, one Notice.** While purlis holds a permission prompt on the chat's hook
 *   (about a minute, HP-6), the Notice says what it asks: the ask's line as the core summed it
 *   up (`asking::shown`: one line, every credential shape masked), drawn as text and nothing
 *   else, and "and N more" past the first. Past that hold, the harness's own prompt decides in
 *   the chat's pane, and the board still says the chat is stopped on it (`Moved.asking`,
 *   #1601): the Notice stays, without the prompt's words, which only the hold carried.
 * - **It answers nothing.** The person answers in the chat's own pane, where the harness shows
 *   the prompt in full, or from the title bar's needs-you list: purlis never approves a
 *   harness's prompt in the person's place.
 * - **It goes when the prompt does**: answered in the window, got past in the chat's pane (a
 *   tool of its own began after the prompt and one came back), the turn that asked ended, its
 *   next prompt, or the chat ended.
