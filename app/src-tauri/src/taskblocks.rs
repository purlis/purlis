//! **One answer for the tasks of one session that hit the same sandbox block** (#1508, V100-57).
//!
//! Several tasks of one session that are blocked on the same host, or on writing the same
//! folder, are asked about in one Notice on the session's tab, and the one answer applies to
//! each task the Notice listed. This is the core's half: it holds the block each open chat is
//! on now ([`Blocks`]), and judges and keeps an answer only against that.
//!
//! # What holds (D-1508-9, fail closed)
//!
//! - **An answer names the exact blocks the person saw**: each task with the block shown for
//!   it ([`SeenBlock`]). The answer is refused whole if any task is not held on that block now
//!   (it was never blocked, it was answered already, it moved on to another block, or it
//!   ended), if the blocks are not one block, or if any task is not recorded below the
//!   session. So a press can grant only a task whose block was on screen, as the dispatch
//!   question's answer is bound to what it showed. Keep blocked is checked the same way.
//! - **Who asked whom is purlis's own record**, the lineage the app wrote when it started each
//!   task ([`purlis_core::reopen::HandedFrom`]). The session itself is never one of its tasks: a
//!   permission given to a session does not reach its tasks, and an answer about its tasks does
//!   not reach the session.
//! - **"For this chat" is each task's own grant**, held under that task's id and judged against
//!   that task's own folder. Every task is judged before anything is kept. If keeping fails part
//!   way (the audit cannot be written), the answer says which tasks it allowed, and only those.
//! - **"For me" and "for the project" are kept once**, audited once more for each other task
//!   listed, and every task listed is owed the restart that takes it.
