//! The extension registry, as the window asks about it.
//!
//! `purlis_core::extension` is the whole of the thinking; this is the wire. Four commands:
//! what has contributed what ([`installed_extensions`]), pick a directory
//! ([`pick_extension`]), read one and ask about it ([`install_extension`]), and record the
//! yes ([`approve_extension`]).
//!
//! **There is no executor here, and that is still deliberate.** ADR 0041 staged it —
//! the registry first, the subprocess afterwards — so that the first extension runtime was not
//! also the thing that invented the list it runs against. The runtime now exists
//! (`purlis_core::executor`, drawn by `crate::views`) and it was built against this list: it
//! re-reads the record and re-takes the fingerprint at every press, and nothing in this file
//! starts anything.
//!
//! **Installing is two clicks, and it has to be**, for the reason `approve_plane` is two: the
//! button that chooses a directory and the button that says yes to what was found in it are
//! different answers to different questions, and collapsing them means the operator approved
//! something before it was drawn. [`install_extension`] writes a row with no approval on it
//! and hands back the question; [`approve_extension`] takes the answer, carrying back the
//! fingerprint that was on screen (charter-app#123's shape).
