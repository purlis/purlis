//! Tells a window when a folder its explorer has expanded changes on disk (FM-1, #1103 story
//! 57): an agent adds or removes a file, and the tree shows it without a manual refresh.
//!
//! **The same watcher as the plane's (`planewatch.rs`), on different folders.** The plane watch
//! deliberately stays out of the clones: a recursive watch there would put one on every folder
//! of every `node_modules/` and `target/`. This one watches exactly the folders a window has
//! expanded, each **non-recursively**, so its cost is what the operator has open and nothing
//! below it. A window hands its whole set each time it changes, and the set is dropped with the
//! window.
//!
//! **The window names folders, never directories.** Each one is a branch and a path inside it,
//! resolved by `purlis_core::files::Root::resolve` with every check the tree's own read makes,
//! the branch found by the bounded reader's child; one that does not resolve is not watched.
//! Each branch is found once per call, however many of its folders are open, and at most
//! `purlis_core::files::WATCHED` folders are watched for a window.
//!
//! **One event per burst** ([`crate::watchset::bursts`]), and an access is not a change: the
//! window reads the folder again when told, and on inotify that read is an `IN_OPEN`.
//!
//! **Every change is told, a short-lived file's included** (#1138). The window lists a folder
//! whenever it is told about it, so it can draw a file whose creation has not been passed on
//! yet; a debouncer that took that file's removal as cancelling its creation never told the
//! window to draw it gone. inotify reports the two separately, so an e2e spec on Linux that
//! removed a file it had just seen drawn found it drawn for ever. So the folder of every event
//! that is a change is told, whatever came after it.
