//! Tells the window when a plane changes on disk under it (charter-app#264).
//!
//! `charter ws todo done` in a terminal deletes a todo's file, and the window's Todos panel
//! went on drawing it for hours: the window read a workspace once, when it was focused, and
//! nothing ever said the plane had moved. The plane is a directory that the CLI, other chats
//! and the operator's editor all write, so a cache of it can only be kept honest by being told.
//!
//! # What is watched, and why it is not the whole plane
//!
//! The directories the panels and the sidebar read, each **non-recursively**:
//!
//! - the plane root (`charter.toml`, which names the default persona, and `workspaces/`
//!   itself appearing);
//! - `workspaces/`, so a workspace made or deleted elsewhere is seen and watched in turn;
//! - each `workspaces/<ws>/` (`workspace.json`, a clone arriving, `todos/` being created);
//! - each `workspaces/<ws>/todos/`, which is the bug;
//! - each `workspaces/<ws>/memory/` and `workspaces/<ws>/sessions/`, and the root's
//!   `sessions/`: the Memory and Sessions panels' stores, so a memory an agent saves or a
//!   session record a smart close writes reaches the panel without some other change having
//!   to happen first (FD-10);
//! - `personas/`, and each `personas/<name>/`, whose `persona.md` a chat reads at its start,
//!   and each `personas/<name>/memory/`, which the Personas panel counts;
//! - `.claude/` and `.claude/agents/`, the harness settings and sub-agents a chat reads at its
//!   start — with the root's `CLAUDE.md`, what the window marks a chat for when it changes under
//!   it (charter#369, [`purlis_core::instructions`]).
//!
//! Not the plane recursively, because a workspace holds its clones: a recursive inotify watch
//! would put one watch on every directory of every clone's `node_modules/` and `target/`, and
//! run the machine out of watches. (On macOS FSEvents streams the subtree regardless and notify
//! drops what is not a direct child in-process, so there the narrow set is about what is
//! REPORTED, not what is watched.) The set is re-read after every batch, so a workspace made
//! in a terminal is watched from then on.
//!
//! # One event per burst
//!
//! The platform's events are folded into bursts ([`crate::watchset::bursts`]) — `git pull`
//! landing ten todos, an editor's write-then-rename — and a burst is one `plane-changed` carrying the plane
//! **and what changed in it**: each path, and what it is part of
//! ([`purlis_core::planechange`]) — a todo of `alpha`, a memory of `steward`, the root's
//! session records. A panel reads again only on a change its answer is made of (FD-10), so a
//! memory an agent saves no longer makes the sidebar list every workspace's todos once more.
//!
//! A burst this cannot place — a path outside the plane, an event notify could not name a path
//! for, a rescan, more paths than a burst holds — is told as `changes: null`, "anything may have moved", and every reader
//! reads again, as each one did before there were kinds.
//!
//! **An access is not a change.** notify's inotify backend watches `IN_OPEN`, and reading a
//! todo opens it — so a window that re-read on every event would re-read because it re-read,
//! forever. [`crate::watchset::matters`] is where that loop is cut.
//!
//! **A file made and removed inside one burst is still told** (#1139). The debouncer this used
//! to fold through took a removal that arrived while the creation was still queued as the file
//! never having been there, and told neither — but a read the window made on another change
//! may already have drawn that file.
//!
//! # When the events are late (#756)
//!
//! macOS's file-event service serves the whole machine, and on a busy Mac it was measured
//! handing a stream a change 4 to 15 seconds late, and sometimes not within four minutes, with
//! no flag saying it had dropped anything (#577). The sidebar's model and the panels answer
//! from what the watch told them (FD-10b), so a change the events never tell is one the window
//! never draws. So the watch also **looks for itself** ([`Windows`]):
//!
//! - **while a window is shown**, every [`SWEEP_EVERY`], it reads the entries of the folders it
//!   watches (one `read_dir` and one `lstat` each, no file is opened) and tells what differs
//!   from its last look and no event has told — after a [`GRACE`] for the event to arrive;
//! - **when a window is focused**, it looks at once, so coming back to the window after a
//!   terminal wrote the project shows the terminal's change. A storm of focus changes is one
//!   look per [`QUIET_FOR`];
//! - **while every window is hidden or minimised** it does not look at all (SC-18, #1392); the
//!   events it hears meanwhile are kept, and the first look after a focus compares against the
//!   look before the windows went;
//! - each change the look had to tell is counted for the doctor's `file events` row
//!   ([`Windows::missed`]).
//!
//! A look tells the changed entries as a burst of their own, placed as the events' are, so the
//! readers that hold the changed answers read again and nothing else does. A folder entry is
//! compared by its being there, not its time: a clone's own writes move its folder's time, and
//! no non-recursive watch tells those.
