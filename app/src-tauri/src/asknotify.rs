//! **System notifications, for asks only** (#1694, spec #1688, I-7).
//!
//! What the person is interrupted for is what blocks work: an **ask** (a permission prompt, a
//! dispatch grant, a sandbox host, a prompt in a harness's terminal, a chat whose turn ended
//! on them). An **update** — a task that failed, a refused commit, a report — is information,
//! and never raises a notification: the registry does not list it (`asking::only_updates`, the
//! registry's own split), so every item it lists is an ask.
//!
//! **What is asked is the asks registry's** (`asking::every_ask`), read again whenever one of
//! its sources may have moved ([`poke`]): a chat moving on the board, its hooks' asks, a
//! dispatch held, a block heard — the events the window reads its own list again on. An ask
//! is notified once, the first time it is read ([`Rules`]); it holds no store of its own past
//! the keys it has seen, so it agrees with the Inbox by construction. A chat that waits on its
//! background agents is not in the queue (#1626), so it is no ask and sends nothing. A chat's
//! own wait is keyed by the chat, so the board's edge into the queue renews it ([`moved`]).
//!
//! **A notification says who asks and what kind of ask it is** (`steward 12 › #3046 drill`,
//! "Asks your permission"), never the ask's words ([`kind_said`]).
//!
//! **One chat's asks a few seconds apart share one notification** ([`TOGETHER`]): the first
//! is sent at once, and each that follows within the window of the one before rides it. Two
//! chats are two notifications.
//!
//! **Nothing is sent while the person is looking** ([`Looking`]): the window holding the
//! ask's project is on screen, focused and has that project in front, and it shows either the
//! chat itself (`Chats::looks_at`, #1486, #1489) or that project's Inbox ([`InboxOpen`], which
//! the window says). Every question unanswered reads as "not looking", so a notification is
//! sent rather than held back: one not needed costs a glance, one needed and not sent costs a
//! chat sitting unanswered.
//!
//! **A click opens the Inbox at that group.** The desktop tells the app nothing of a click but
//! that it is brought forward, so the window holding the project is sent [`NOTIFIED`] with
//! the chat, and lands there the next time it comes to the front (`askNotices.ts`).
