//! The app's half of `charter handoff`: opening, in a window the operator is looking at, the
//! chat a chat of its own handed work to (charter-app#204).
//!
//! `charter handoff` does every check of the request in front of the open, and then asks the
//! app over the hook socket, in two lines on one connection: a ticket, and the open that
//! spends it. `purlis_core::hookwire::OpenChat` argues what that ticket is worth and what it
//! is not, and it is not repeated here.
//!
//! **A handoff is a dispatch in handoff mode, and this app decides it** (#1444, spec #1434
//! decisions 4 and 5). The harness's permission prompt consents to nothing. What does is the
//! dispatch grant: a handoff to the asking chat's own persona needs none, and one to another
//! persona is held with its brief until the person allows the pair on the asking chat's tab,
//! or is refused plainly for a chat nobody is at. Its limits, its depth, a policy's locks and
//! its profile are a task's, because one function decides both ([`dispatch_it`]). Nobody
//! approves the brief: it is the new chat's first message, it is in the dispatch's record,
//! and the Notice for a first grant shows it in full.
//!
//! What this module adds is **the questions only the app can answer**, and the one control
//! that module's argument rests on, which is visibility:
//!
//! - **The asking chat is one this app has open**, and the new chat starts on **its persona's
//!   own profile** where that persona's definition names one, else on the asking chat's, read
//!   from the app's own record of that chat (#1445). Either way it is a profile the project
//!   already offers on this machine and has approved
//!   (`purlis_core::personaprofile::for_dispatch`): a persona's file is one a chat can write,
//!   so a name it gives is only looked up, never run. One this machine does not offer falls
//!   back to the asking chat's profile, and the answer and the new chat's stamp say so
//!   (D-1445-8). The harness follows the profile, so a Claude Code chat can hand work to a
//!   persona that runs on Codex, and the first message reaches it by that harness's own route.
//! - **The first message carries the stamp** of a handoff from that chat
//!   (`purlis_core::handoff::is_stamped_from`), so the chat the operator finds on the strip
//!   always says where it came from.
//! - **It lands on a strip, and it does not take the operator's screen.** The window is told
//!   ([`ARRIVED`]) and draws a tab in the target workspace's strip without bringing it to the
//!   front and without raising the window. See [`Arrived`] for why.
//! - **It is named for its task** (charter-app#258): the `--name` the handoff carried, or the
//!   ordinary `<persona> <N>`. And it says where it came from by the parent's NAME — in its
//!   first message, and in the note its tab and header draw — never by the parent's number.
//!
//! And it answers the one ask a dispatched chat makes back: **a report** (charter-app#259,
//! #1436). The chat it goes to is the asker the app recorded when it started the chat, never
//! one the reporting chat names, and only for a task, or for a handed-off chat in the one turn
//! its stop gives it. **A handoff owes no report** (#1515, #1471): an open that still asks for
//! one is refused, naming `purlis dispatch`. See [`report_it`].
//!
//! # A dispatched task (#1436)
//!
//! A **task** is the other mode of the same act (ADR 0090, #1434): one chat starting another,
//! which runs as a persona and owes the chat that asked one report. It is answered here, on the
//! same road: the ticket, the stamped first message, the decision, the chat's start, the
//! lineage on its record and the report. What differs is what the request carries. A handoff's
//! carries a stamp and the workspace the work moves to, which this module checks ([`moving`]);
//! a task's carries a task's name. For both, **everything else is this app's own record of the
//! asking chat** ([`dispatch_it`]): who it is, where it works, what it runs as, and whether it
//! may. `purlis_core::dispatchdecision::decide` answers that last question, for every caller.
//!
//! # Where a task works (#1453)
//!
//! A dispatch may say one word about where its chat works: another workspace, or a worktree of
//! its own (`purlis_core::dispatchplace`). **The app cuts that worktree, never a chat**, by
//! the brokered route, under a folder and a branch purlis names for the dispatch; the persona
//! chat is started in it, on the sandbox the project compiles for its persona in that folder,
//! and purlis merges nothing for it by itself: only the person does, from the task's Changes
//! tab (#1511). Which branch that is, is written on the dispatch's record,
//! and the report names it from there.
