//! Tells a window when anything in a branch it shows the changes of moves (FM-4, #1107): an
//! agent's first write into a folder nobody opened is heard, and the branch's change markers
//! are read again without a refresh.
//!
//! **Not the tree's watch** (`filewatch.rs`), which watches exactly the folders a window has
//! open so it can read each again. This one listens to the whole branch, and says only *which
//! branch* moved: the window reads its status again.
//!
//! **What the whole branch costs depends on the platform**, so it is watched two ways
//! (`purlis_core::files::Root`):
//! - where one watch covers a tree (FSEvents on macOS, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows), the
//!   branch's folder, recursively. Adding folders one at a time there restarts the stream each
//!   time, measured at about 6 ms a folder on macOS, so a branch of 2,000 folders would take 12
//!   seconds to watch; one recursive watch takes milliseconds.
//! - where a recursive watch is one per folder (inotify), the folders git knows, each
//!   non-recursively, so `node_modules/` and `target/` cost nothing. A folder created in one is
//!   added when it appears.
//!
//! **A move that cannot change the status is not told**: one only inside what git ignores (a
//! build writing `target/`), or inside git's own folder. Asked once per branch per burst
//! (`Root::matters`), of the bounded reader (`purlis_core::files::Reader`, D-88h), and
//! **never on the watch's own thread**: each branch's check runs on a worker of its own, one at
//! a time, with what moved meanwhile asked next. A branch whose check hangs (an ignore file that
//! is a FIFO) holds only its own worker until the reader's deadline, which counts as "it
//! matters", and every other branch's markers keep moving.
//!
//! **The cockpit's refs are heard too** (#1152). A commit that writes no file in the branch's
//! folder — `git commit --amend --no-edit`, a commit of what was staged — moves only git's own
//! folder, which the checks above pass over. So for the branch a window's sidebar is focused on
//! ([`BranchWatch::focus`]), and only that one, the folders holding its refs
//! (`purlis_core::files::Root::refs`) are watched one by one, and a burst naming one of those
//! files tells the window as a move in the folder would. A burst naming the cockpit's `HEAD` (a
//! checkout in its folder) has its refs found again, off the watch's thread, so the branch
//! checked out now is the one whose ref is watched.
//!
//! **Every burst is told by what it named** ([`crate::watchset::bursts`], #1139): a file made
//! and removed inside one is still a move. A burst that is everything — the platform lost
//! track, a watcher error, more paths than a burst holds — moves every branch listened to, and
//! may have made a folder, so a branch watched folder by folder is listed again.
//!
//! **The one watch per repo** (FD-11, #651). A clone whose save standing is shared
//! (`purlis_core::reposave::shared_standing`: auto-save's look, the Saving rows) asks to be
//! watched here too ([`BranchWatch::want`]), so the explorer's markers and the standing hear
//! one watch and one check per burst, not one each. A move that matters touches the
//! standing (`purlis_core::planegit::touch`) as well as telling the windows, and while the
//! clone's whole tree is watched its standing is *covered*: read again on what moved, and
//! otherwise only on its long backstop — about one read in twenty minutes for a monorepo
//! nobody touches (`purlis_core::standings::WATCHED_SHARE`). Its plane let go of, it is let
//! go of too.
//!
//! **Only a watch of the whole tree covers** (D-FD11h, fail closed): FSEvents and
//! `ReadDirectoryChangesW`, [`How::Whole`]. A clone watched folder by folder (inotify) is never
//! covered, and keeps the standing's clock: a folder deleted and made again, a folder made
//! between a listing and its watch, or folders that could not be listed ([`How::Unread`]) all
//! leave edits no watch reports. A burst that says the platform lost track or erred
//! ([`crate::watchset::Burst::lost`]) uncovers every clone and watches each again; a clone is
//! covered again only once that watch has been made, and its standing is read again then.
//!
//! **Nothing here walks a tree.** Nothing keeps a file-id cache, and links are not followed: a
//! link an agent puts in its branch to the operator's home is never read through.
//! On inotify, the folders a branch is listed again with as folders appear are listed at most
//! once a second, and the app watches at most a quarter of the user's inotify watches.
