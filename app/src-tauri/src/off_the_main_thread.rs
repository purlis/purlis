//! Which commands answer off the thread that asked (SC-2, #680).
//!
//! Tauri runs a synchronous command on the thread that handed it the request, which in the app
//! is the main thread: the one that pumps the window's events. A command that walks the plane's
//! files there holds the window for as long as the walk takes, and a plane with dozens of
//! workspaces and thousands of memories makes that a hitch a person sees. So the commands that
//! read every workspace, every memory or every session record are `async` and do their reading
//! on a blocking thread, as `workspace_repos` already did for git.
//!
//! **Every command that runs git answers off the window's thread too** (#1007): a git process
//! takes milliseconds to start before it does anything, so no such command can stay under the
//! 1 ms the window can spare. That is the worktree verbs (list, which piece a chat is in,
//! remove, done, merge, and New branch, which already was), and a workspace's create, its
//! at-risk reading and its remove. Create and remove also read the sidebar's model again under
//! its lock, which the watcher holds while it applies a change. Settings' two lists of grants
//! name who committed each of the project's grants, which asks git, so the dispatch grants'
//! read and revoke and the sandbox grants' read and revoke answer off it as well (#1543).
//!
//! **And every command that reads a branch's files** (#1007): a file for the light editor,
//! which may be 5 MiB, and Move aside…, which asks git whether `AGENTS.md` is the operator's.
//! Copy path and Reveal place the path on the disk off it too, then put it on the clipboard or
//! hand it to the file manager. The rest of `piecefiles.rs` already was. So does "Start a chat
//! here", which finds its branch's folder through the bounded reader: a busy reader gate holds
//! that ask for its deadline, twice over.
//!
//! `chat_usage` stays synchronous too: it reads one file of sixteen rows, about 30 µs, and walks
//! nothing. So does `workspace_focused`, which checks a name and hands the extensions' report
//! to a thread of its own.
//!
//! Smart close's offer, its start and its cancel stay synchronous, for a terminal's reason. They
//! run no git, and the offer and the cancel read only what the app holds in memory, well under
//! 1 ms. The start can also touch the disk: for a task that had reported and was about to be
//! ended, it stands that end down (`dispatched::stand_down`), which reads the project's dispatch
//! records to find the task's newest one and writes it again marked kept open (#1610). Only a
//! task's start does that, once. The start types its prompt into the chat's pane, and a cancel
//! pressed straight after must land after it: Tauri keeps that order only for synchronous
//! commands, and that order is worth the one read and write.
//!
//! A terminal's own commands stay synchronous on purpose. They take well under 5 ms, and the
//! window relies on their order: a pane's resize must land before the watch that follows it
//! (#891). Nothing in this module runs in the app; it is the tests that hold both halves.
