//! **The network, as the window shows it** (#1662, spec #1661): Settings' Network page (Open
//! hosts, Allowed, Blocked lately) and each chat's Network view, both read from this machine's
//! network record (`purlis_core::sandboxblock::record`), and what writes that record from the
//! app: every block a chat's sandbox met, and every Allow and removal a person made.
//!
//! **Nothing here changes what a chat may reach.** Allow on Blocked lately is the same judged,
//! audited Allow a block's Notice makes (`sandboxing::judged`), kept for this project on this
//! machine or for everyone in it; a chat takes it from its next start, as every Allow made
//! outside its own Notice does.
//!
//! **What the record holds is data.** A chat's name is what the person called it, and a host a
//! block names came on a line the chat's hook sent: both are shown as text and never followed.
