//! The opener: how a plane gets into the app when no terminal handed one over.
//!
//! **The app used to have exactly one way in — the directory it was launched from.** A
//! double-clicked `.app` has `/` for a working directory, so the operator who opened charter
//! from the dock got a window that said `No plane` and offered nothing to do about it. ADR
//! 0033 is the decision that a project IS a plane and that the app opens one; this module is
//! the door.
//!
//! Four things live here and they are one story:
//!
//! - **what to offer** — the planes this machine remembers ([`recent_planes`]), and the folder
//!   picker for one it does not ([`pick_project`]);
//! - **what to ask** — a plane the operator has not approved is not opened, it is *described*,
//!   and the description is the dialog ([`Ask`]);
//! - **what an answer buys** — [`approve_plane`] records the yes and opens the plane, and it
//!   is the only way into `Planes`' second mint of `Approved`;
//! - **what a window holds** — [`window_holds_planes`] takes the tab strip and writes it into
//!   this machine's store, and [`planes_to_restore`] reads it back at the next cold launch
//!   (ADR 0033, decision 28). The restore says *which* projects; every one of them is opened
//!   through [`open_plane`] like any other, so it is not a way past the ask above.
//!
//! **Nothing here decides whether to ask.** `machine::Store::consent` decides, against the
//! plane as it is on this disk at this instant, inside `Planes::open_if_approved`; this module
//! carries the question to the window and the answer back. A second opinion about consent,
//! formed in the layer that draws it, is the shape of every gate that has later turned out not
//! to bite.

/// `plane_is_this_repo` is the operator asking for the old shape **by name**, which is how
/// charter's own plane exists, and it comes from a box they ticked.
///
/// **The directory is the directory, and no walk decides otherwise.** `plane::place` — what
/// the CLI's `init` uses — reads `$CHARTER_ROOT` and walks up to an enclosing plane, which is
/// right for a command run where somebody is standing and wrong for one handed a path: a new
/// project inside `~/code` would otherwise be scaffolded into whatever plane happens to be
/// above it. The walk is still asked, through `plane::find_root`, but only to REFUSE: a
/// directory inside a plane is a place for a workspace's clone, not for a second plane.
///
/// **And that is not a second walk** (charter-app#178). The operator's ruling was worded as
/// *walk as the CLI does, and refuse rather than write when the walk lands somewhere other
/// than the directory picked*, and a reviewer asked the fair question about the paragraph
/// above: if this asks `find_root` where the CLI asks `place`, the two can drift, and the day
/// they do, the refusal starts naming a plane `charter init` would not have chosen. They
/// cannot. `find_root` and `place` are **one** walk in this core — `plane::walk`, which is a
/// single function on purpose and says so at length, because two copies of it are two answers
/// about one directory (M2.9, then M2.16). The two differ in what they do with a `None` and
/// in reading `$CHARTER_ROOT`, and neither difference can reach the `Some` this refusal is
/// made of. `$CHARTER_ROOT` is the one thing deliberately not honoured here, and that is the
/// difference this command wants: a variable inherited from whatever shell opened the app is
/// not an answer about a folder somebody just pointed at.
/// `the_refusal_names_the_plane_the_cli_would_have_scaffolded_into` holds the identity, so a
/// change that made the two walks disagree lands in this file.
///
/// **`adopt` is the third answer, and ADR 0035's default** (charter-app#175). Beside "refuse"
/// and "scaffold the old shape" there is now "make the plane here and take that repository as
/// its first clone", which is what the record actually decided — *"`charter init` on an
/// existing repo adopts that repo as the plane's first clone and makes the plane beside it"*.
/// It is two directories because it is two answers: the dialog asks for both, and neither is
