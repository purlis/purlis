//! The right-hand panels for the focused workspace: its repos, their branches, CI, its
//! todos and the plane's personas (spec decision 1). This module only reads: what the panels
//! write — a todo recorded, closed or forgotten, a persona made or deleted (SI-3) — goes through
//! `todos.rs` and `personas.rs`, and the panels are read again from the disk afterwards.
//!
//! # Two answers, and that is the design
//!
//! `of` is a directory listing and a handful of small files. It comes back at once, so the
//! todos and the persona row are on screen the moment a workspace is focused.
//!
//! `repo_states` runs `git status` once per clone, which is bounded at five seconds each and
//! is the only slow thing a panel does. It is its own command so that nothing else waits for
//! it, and the window draws "reading…" in the meantime.
//!
//! **Nothing here crosses a network, at all.** The CI cell is read out of
//! `.charter/cache/glstate.json`, which some other process writes; `purlis_core::cistate`
//! says why in full. A panel that fetched would put a forge token in the process that draws
//! the window and hold that window for as long as `gh` takes.
