//! The Inbox's alerts' one question: what is wrong in every project this process holds (#1695:
//! the Alerts drawer's rows are Notices in the Inbox now).
//!
//! **Cross-project by construction.** An alert is about a plane — its pin, its front door,
//! its workspaces' layout, its root — and not about the workspace or the chat on screen, so
//! the reading is the window's and asks about every plane at once. The command takes no plane
//! for exactly that reason: a reading that could be asked about one project could be wired to
//! the one in front and quietly stop being about the rest.
//!
//! The deciding is `purlis_core::alerts`, the port of charter's `_alerts`, which also draws
//! the terminal status line's rows — so the Inbox and `purlis statusline` cannot disagree
//! about whether a plane has anything to say.
