/**
 * **A tab's menu opens Settings at that tab's level**, in the built app (#1213): the menu key on
 * the project's tab, then Project settings…, opens Settings at the Project level; on a
 * workspace's tab, then Workspace settings…, at that workspace's level. Both from the keyboard,
 * which SE-23 fixed on both strips.
 *
 * `src/settings/TabMenus.test.tsx` holds the rest of the ticket — the project right-clicked is
 * the one brought forward, and the palette's rows and the gears land on the tab the menu opened —
 * and `SettingsGears.test.tsx` that the menu key opens each tab's menu at all. What only a
 * scenario can say is that the path holds in the real window with the real core behind it.
 *
 * **The menu key is sent as the keydown the page would get.** WebDriver's key table has no
 * context-menu key, and a WebDriver keystroke is synthesised inside the page anyway (see
 * `settings-gears.e2e.ts`), so the spec dispatches the `keydown` on the tab that has the focus —
 * exactly what `Menus.openFromTheKeyboard` listens for (D-1213-b).
 *
 * **Its own project, copied into the run's tree**, opened through the opener and closed by its
 * tab's own × — one app process serves the whole run, so a project or a Settings tab left on a
 * strip here is what every later spec reads. Each Settings tab it opens is closed by its own ×
 * first.
