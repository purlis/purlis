/**
 * Making a workspace and deleting one, in the built app, against the real core.
 *
 * **What this is for is the DELETE, and one claim about it: the core's guard decides.**
 * `charter workspace remove` refuses over work that removing the workspace would discard —
 * `wscmd::work_at_risk`, which runs inside that command between the name check and
 * `remove_dir_all`. `app/src/WorkspaceLifecycle.test.tsx` pins what the window does with the
 * refusal against a mocked core; nothing there can show that the guard is REALLY in the path,
 * because the mock is what refuses. Here the clone is a real git repository with a real
 * uncommitted file in it, the refusal is the one `wscmd::remove` wrote, and whether the
 * directory is still on disk afterwards is read off the disk.
 *
 * **Its own project, copied into the run's tree** (charter-app#129 and #132's fence): this
 * spec deletes directories, so it may only ever be pointed at a plane the run itself made.
 * The plane the launch opened is never touched, and the project is closed again at the end.
 *
 * **Driven from the palette, not from the context menu.** Both surfaces run the SAME catalogue
 * row — that is the whole design (`app/src/actions.ts`), and `Menus.test.tsx` is where the menu
 * being a view of that catalogue is asserted. What this spec needs is the path from a row to
 * the core, which the palette reaches by keystroke alone; one test below does right-click a
 * real tab, because whether a WebView context menu opens under WebDriver is a measurement this
 * repo has never taken and a claim in a PR is not one.
