/**
 * **A pin to a workspace that is gone is kept dormant** (NO-1 #1223, ruling V91c as amended),
 * in the built app against the real core and the real machine store.
 *
 * `app/src/Pins.test.tsx` drives the same thing against a mocked core. What only a real window
 * can show is the whole path: a workspace directory going away on disk, the project watcher
 * telling the window, the Notice, the store **still holding the pin** — read back from the core,
 * never from the strip — and the workspace coming back drawn in its own place.
 *
 * **Its own project, copied into the run's tree**, as `workspace-lifecycle.e2e.ts` does: this
 * spec moves a workspace directory away, so it is never pointed at the project the launch
 * opened. **It restores what it changed** — the directory, this project's pins in the store, and
 * the window, which lets the project go through its `×` — because one app process serves the
 * whole run and a spec that leaked state broke train 38.
