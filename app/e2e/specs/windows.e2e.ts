/**
 * A project tab split into an OS window of its own, and moved back (charter#126; ADR 0033,
 * amended 2026-09-26), in the built app.
 *
 * What only the built app can show: that a second window exists at all, that it is granted
 * the commands it needs (a split window with no grant draws nothing, ADR 0052), that it draws
 * the project it was handed, and that the project comes back — by the palette's row, and by
 * the window's close button — with the core holding it the whole time.
 *
 * **Every row is pressed from the palette**, in whichever window it is about: each window has
 * its own palette and its own `F2`, which is one of the three things #126 named.
 *
 * **It leaves the app as it found it**: back in the main window, with its own project closed by
 * `close_plane`, and its tab gone from the strip. One app process serves the whole run, and a
 * project left drawn here is the strip the next spec (`workspace-explorer.e2e.ts`) reads. The
 * core tells every window drawing a project it closed (`plane-closed`, #1242), so the tab goes
 * however the close was asked.
