/**
 * The window over a day: closed to the tray with every session still running, and asked to
 * quit with what that would end named on screen.
 *
 * What is not here: pressing Quit for real. WebdriverIO's Tauri service keeps one app process
 * for every spec file in a run, so an exit here would take the rest of the run with it. That
 * half is `tools/relaunch.mjs`, which quits the app and starts it again — the only test that
 * can, because it owns the process.
 *
 * This spec runs before the others (specs run in name order) and leaves the window as it
 * found it, so nothing below depends on it having run.
