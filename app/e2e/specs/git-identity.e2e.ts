/**
 * **A machine with no git identity is told so by a Notice** (#1250), in the built app against
 * the real core and the real doctor.
 *
 * `app/src/DoctorNotice.window.test.tsx` drives the Notice against a mocked core. What only a
 * real window can show is the whole path: git asked through charter's hardened runner, the
 * preflight the window runs when a project opens, and the finding standing in the band.
 *
 * **Every other spec runs with an identity** (`THE_RUNS_HOME`, D-1250-8), so this one takes it
 * away: it empties the run's own `.gitconfig` — never the runner's — opens a project of its
 * own, whose preflight then finds no identity, and puts the file back before anything else is
 * asked. One app process serves the whole run, so it also lets its project go again.
