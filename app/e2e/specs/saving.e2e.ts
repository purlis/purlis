/**
 * **The save indicator and the save button, in the built app** (charter-app#294, ADR 0051).
 *
 * A copy of the `daily` fixture made into a git repository with one commit and no remote, opened
 * through the window's own gate. A file written into it is what the title bar then says is
 * unsaved; the bar's save button runs the core's one save function, and with no remote the
 * commit is as far as it goes — so the bar moves from *1 changed* back to *Saved*.
 *
 * What is proved here and not in jsdom: `plane_saving` reads a real repository, `save_plane`
 * commits in it through `planegit::save_as`, and the bar re-reads after the save.
 *
 * **It leaves the window as it found it**: the project it opens it lets go of.
