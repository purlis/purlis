 * **A chat asks, the person answers in the Inbox, and the chat carries on** (#1692, spec #1688).
 *
 * The whole path, with nothing faked past the harness: the reporting harness runs Codex's
 * `PermissionRequest` hook through the real binary (`ASKS_A_PERMISSION`), the hook hands the ask
 * to the app over the socket the app opened and waits, the asks registry lists it, the title
 * bar's ✋ counts it and opens the Inbox, Allow there goes back on the chat's own hook, and the
 * harness prints what it does once it is allowed. Unanswered, the hook would decide nothing and
 * the line would never be printed.
