/**
 * **Locate… re-points a remembered project that moved** (#1291's third line; NO-5 #1237 and
 * ST-2 #1226), in the built app against the real core and this run's own machine store: a
 * project opened once, closed, moved on disk, listed as gone in Settings › You › This machine,
 * located at its new place there, and the store read back from the core, never from the row.
 *
 * `GoneProjectNotice.test.tsx`, `ThisMachine.test.tsx` and the core's tests hold the rest against
 * a mocked side each. What only a real window can say is that the folder the picker answers with
 * goes through the window's Locate… to `locate_project`, and the store the next launch reads
 * holds the new place.
 *
 * **The native folder dialog is the one thing stood in for** (D-1291-1). It is the operating
 * system's window, which no WebDriver reaches, and no build of the app has a seam for it. So the
 * page's IPC request for `pick_project` alone is answered here, with the folder a person would
 * have picked, at the one place a page sends every command through: `fetch` to Tauri's `ipc:`
 * protocol. Every other command goes to the core, `locate_project` included. The stand-in counts
 * what it answered, so a build that sent the command some other way fails here saying so, rather
 * than as a dialog nobody can close.
 *
 * **Its own project, copied into the run's tree**, and nothing of it left behind: one app process
 * serves the whole run, so the project is closed, its Settings tab closed by its own ×, the stand-in
 * taken out, and the store's entry forgotten at the end.
