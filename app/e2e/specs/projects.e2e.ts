/**
 * A window holding more than one project, in the built app (ADR 0033, decision 23).
 *
 * **What this is for.** The operator asked for Zed's project tabs by name, and the reason he
 * wanted one window per project before that was the same one: fifty chats in project A must
 * not be torn down because he glanced at project B. So the claim under test is not "a second
 * tab appears" — it is that the first project's sessions are *still the same sessions* after
 * the window has been somewhere else and come back. `running_sessions` is asked before and
 * after, because that is the only answer a tab strip cannot fake.
 *
 * It also pins the half of decision 28 a scenario run can reach. Restoring at a COLD launch
 * needs a second launch, and a run shares one app process — so what is proved here is the
 * other end of that record: the window writes down what it holds, into the real machine
 * store, and `planes_to_restore` reads it back. Whether the next launch opens what comes back
 * is `App`'s, in `src/Projects.test.tsx`; the store's own round trip is `machine.rs`'s.
 *
 * **It leaves the window as it found it.** Specs share one app process and run in name order:
 * the second project is closed at the end, the chat this spec opened is closed with it, and
 * the project the launch opened is never touched.

 * project is a copy of the same one: two tabs both reading `daily`, and a `Close project
 * daily` button that could be either. The path tells them apart on screen; the name has to
 * tell them apart for the driver.
 *
 * **Resolved**, because `Planes::open` canonicalises every root it takes and a `PlaneId` IS
 * that spelling — so on macOS, where `tmpdir()` is `/var/folders/…` and `/var` is a link into
 * `/private`, the path this spec would otherwise compare against is not the one the app is
