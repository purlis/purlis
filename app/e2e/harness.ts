 * out at `workspaces/ide/charter-app`, inside the operator's own control plane, so an app
 * started here with nothing pinned walks up and finds THAT plane: a scenario run wrote 49 of
 * its own chats into `/Users/aharon/IdeaProjects/charter/.charter/app/reopen.json`, and the
 * operator found them by opening charter. The record is an execution input (ADR 0035), so
 * that is a test suite leaving programs behind in a real plane, not only a mess.
 *
 * Pinning `$CHARTER_ROOT` is how a run *avoids* that, and it is not enough on its own: a
 * config that stops pinning it goes green and poisons a plane. So every process also carries
 * `$CHARTER_PLANE_FENCE` pointing here, and the binary the scenario tests drive is built with
 * the fence in it (`e2e` turns on `purlis-core/fenced`). A run that resolves any plane this
 * tree does not hold dies naming it, in the job that broke it.
 *
 * Made once per launcher process, and `wdio.state.conf.ts` and `wdio.bench.conf.ts` spread
 * `wdio.conf.ts`, so all three share it — which is what makes it the fence for all of them.
 *
 * **It has to survive the fork, and that is why it goes through the environment.**
 * WebdriverIO runs each spec file in a worker process, and a worker imports this module
 * again: a plain `mkdtempSync` here would give the worker a SECOND tree, so a plane a spec
 * copies for itself — `opener.e2e.ts`'s stranger, `projects.e2e.ts`'s second project — would
 * land outside the fence the launcher gave the app, and the app would die opening the very
 * plane the spec made for it. The variable is inherited by the fork, so both halves of the
 * run name one tree. A worker that somehow did not inherit it makes its own and the app
 * refuses: wrong, but loudly and in the run that is wrong, which is the whole point.
